COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):

  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

  • Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a));  
  • § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103;  
  • Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
  • Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26 (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003));  
  • G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail-condition standard (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

Immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no adequate alternative remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 supplies the remedy. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without written findings.  
  • 2 Dec 2025: Trial set. No other timely relief can prevent ongoing harm.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) confirms severe dopamine-deficit ADHD that responds only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel presented a valid prescription and expert evidence. Despite this, the District Court issued a per se drug ban and mandated random testing without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
  2. Does mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
  1. Bail and pre-trial release are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004).  
  2. DOJ regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se amphetamine ban denies Petitioner’s sole effective treatment.  
  3. Blanket exclusions violate Title II absent evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Massachusetts Trial Court settlement similarly bars pre-trial blanket medication bans.  
  4. Reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is prohibited. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
  – Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67 (2001).  
  – Without individualized suspicion or a “special needs” showing, suspicionless testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/ART. 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL  
  – “Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017).  
  – Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
  1. Substantive Liberty—Medical Autonomy: Pre-trial detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brothershan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018).  
  2. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against the need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
  – MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 – “LEAST RESTRICTIVE”  
  – Bail conditions must be the least restrictive means of ensuring appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020).  
  – The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108 (1990).

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
  – Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra.  
  – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992)); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
  – Pre-trial detainees cannot be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary, including expedited consideration, to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm.
