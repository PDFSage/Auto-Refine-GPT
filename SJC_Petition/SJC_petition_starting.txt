PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner invokes this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power, G. L. c. 211, § 3, to vacate Woburn District Court No. 5531568 (entered 26 September 2024) that (1) imposes a categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and (2) mandates random urinalysis as conditions of pre-trial release under G. L. c. 276, § 58.[11] These conditions are unconstitutional and illegal because they (a) deny a reasonable accommodation for a documented disability—severe dopamine-deficit ADHD controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine, see Exhibit 1 (Oct 2024 neuropsychological report, Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH)—and (b) are unsupported by individualized findings linking the disability-related medication to flight risk or danger.

The blanket ban conflicts with controlling federal statutes and regulations, settled precedent, and recent federal-court injunctions prohibiting similar policies.[22] The challenged order therefore (i) violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution; (ii) creates perverse incentives that endanger, rather than protect, public safety; and (iii) inflicts irreparable harm daily.

II. JURISDICTION

A Single Justice may review bail and all related conditions where those conditions infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002).[15] G. L. c. 211, § 3 supplies the remedy when no other avenue affords adequate relief. See Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4-5 (July 17 2025).[25]

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

• 26 Sep 2024 – Arraignment on one count of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A; challenged conditions imposed.
• 17 Jul 2025 – Middlesex Superior Court denied review without findings.
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025. No other remedy exists.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED
	1.	Whether a blanket prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violates the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due-process guarantees.
	2.	Whether such a prohibition is an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

(Insert ¶¶ 7–16 of prior Superior-Court draft verbatim.)

VI. ARGUMENT

A. The Conditions Violate the ADA and § 504.

Title II forbids a public entity from denying a qualified individual with a disability the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities” of that entity.[1] Bail is a “program.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527-29 (2004).[2] Random urinalysis and a total drug ban categorically deny Petitioner meaningful access to pre-trial liberty because the only effective treatment for his disability is proscribed. The ADA’s integration mandate, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), and its corrections-specific rule, § 35.152(b)(2), require equal access to medication in custodial settings; those standards apply a fortiori to non-custodial pre-trial supervision. Federal courts uniformly hold that Title II applies to “all phases” of the criminal process, including bail. See Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).
	1.	Failure to Provide Reasonable Modification.
The District Court made no individualized inquiry as required by 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a), which demand an “individualized assessment” grounded in current medical evidence before restricting a disabled person’s medication.[24] See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999)[3]; Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014).[5] The First Circuit reiterated that a blanket policy that “categorically excludes” disabled individuals without a direct-threat analysis violates Title II. See Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9 2024).[35]
	2.	Persuasive and Binding Authority.
Every federal court to address medication bans similar to the one at bar has enjoined them. See, e.g., Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019) (affirming preliminary injunction compelling jail to provide buprenorphine; Title II applies at booking and beyond)[40]; Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018)[41]; Kortlever v. Whatcom County, No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29 2019)[42]; P.G. v. Jefferson County, No. 5:21-cv-388-DNH-ML (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 7 2021)[22]; Hernandez v. Cnty. of Monterey, 110 F. Supp. 3d 929, 958-60 (N.D. Cal. 2015).[36] The Department of Justice reached the same conclusion in multiple enforcement actions and in its 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court, which expressly forbids blanket medication prohibitions in pre-trial contexts.[9]

Because § 504 standards parallel the ADA’s, Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2004),[6] the same analysis controls here. Neither Title II nor § 504 permits a court to force cessation of lawfully prescribed medication absent a fundamental-alteration or direct-threat showing, both of which require evidence-based findings.[24]

B. Fourth-, Fifth-, Eighth-, and Fourteenth-Amendment Violations.

“Liberty is the norm”—pre-trial detention or restraint is the “carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987).[12] The Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1951)[27] prohibit “excessive” bail and conditions. Massachusetts embraces the same principle. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017).[14] Recent decisions reaffirm that judges must articulate findings whenever liberty is constrained. See Walsh v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 567, 573-74 (2020) (findings “better practice” whenever conditions are likely to result in detention); Jones, slip op. at 5-6 (2025).[25]
	1.	Substantive Due Process – Bodily Integrity.
Forcing cessation of essential medication offends substantive-due-process jurisprudence protecting bodily integrity. See Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229-31 (1990)[30]; Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135-36 (1992)[31]; Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178-80 (2003).[32] Massachusetts cases likewise recognize a liberty interest in medical autonomy. See Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626-27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 103-04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).[17]
	2.	Fourth Amendment – Random Urinalysis as Unreasonable Search.
Random urinalysis constitutes a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989)[43]; Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77-78 (2001)[44]. Absent individualized suspicion or a “special needs” justification, compulsory testing violates the Fourth Amendment and Article 14. Here, the District Court articulated none. Massachusetts courts demand reasonableness tailored to legitimate governmental interests. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252-53 (2016) (probation search must be based on reasonable suspicion).[45]
	3.	Procedural Due Process.
The District Court provided no written findings, rendering the order punitive, not regulatory. Cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-37 (1979)[13]; Lopez-Valenzuela v. Arpaio, 770 F.3d 772, 781-85 (9th Cir. 2014).[16]

C. Violation of Massachusetts Equal Rights Act.

G. L. c. 93, § 103 guarantees freedom from disability discrimination by any entity.[19] Denying Petitioner access to the only medication that allows equal participation is discriminatory per se. See Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851-52 (2004).[29] MERA provides broader relief than federal analogues and must be construed liberally. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766-67 (1997).[37]

D. Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58.

Section 58 requires conditions to be the “least restrictive” necessary.[11] Trial-Court Guidelines reiterate that only tailored conditions may be imposed.[10] SJC precedent demands specific findings linking each condition to statutory factors. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87-89 (2016)[26]; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75-77 (2020).[28] Less-restrictive alternatives exist—verified prescriptions, supervised dispensing, clinician reports, electronic A&D monitoring—none considered. Cf. Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018).[17] Failure to explore alternatives constitutes an abuse of discretion. See Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172-73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112-13 (1990).[38]

E. Superintendence Standard.

Relief is warranted when a lower-court order causes a “substantial infringement of a substantive right.” Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005).[18] The continuing deprivation of Petitioner’s prescribed medication meets that threshold. See also Jones, slip op. at 5-6.[25]

F. Injunctive-Relief Factors (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)).

Likelihood of success, irreparable harm, balance of harms, and public interest all favor Petitioner; see supra Sections VI-A–D. Congress expressly found that “historical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself a harm.[33]

G. Presumption of Innocence.

Pre-trial defendants “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-37.[13]

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

(a) VACATE the no-drug and random-testing conditions forthwith and REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised therapeutic micro-dosing;
(b) in the alternative, REPORT the constitutional questions to the full court; and
(c) grant such other relief as justice requires.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

Petitioner suffers ongoing cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm that cannot be remedied post-trial. Immediate relief is essential.
