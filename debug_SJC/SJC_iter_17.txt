COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang seeks vacatur of two pre-trial release conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They therefore violate:  

  • Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139 (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
  • Fourth Amendment and Article 14 search-and-seizure protections (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
  • Eighth Amendment and Article 26 prohibition on excessive bail or conditions (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due-process guarantees (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003));  
  • G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No adequate remedy exists in the trial court or on appeal; immediate superintendence relief is required to prevent irreparable cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).  

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: District Court (No. 5531568) orders pre-trial conditions challenged here.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.  

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  
Petitioner suffers severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his symptoms. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random testing without any medical or threat assessment.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Whether a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violates Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees.  
  2. Whether suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
  3. Whether these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Title II/§ 504 Apply to Bail and Pre-Trial Release  
   – Title II bars any “public entity” from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from its “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. 29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19–20.  
   – Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).

2. The District Court Denied a Required Individualized Assessment  
   – DOJ regulations require case-by-case assessment of disability-related medication before exclusion. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
   – The court imposed a per se ban on “any illegal drugs,” foreclosing Petitioner’s only effective treatment—micro-dosed amphetamine—without any inquiry.

3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful  
   – Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
   – Federal courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
   – The 2022 DOJ-Massachusetts Trial Court Settlement similarly bars pre-trial blanket medication prohibitions.

4. Reliance on Stereotypes Is Prohibited  
   – Congress found that “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No findings here link micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search  
   – Compulsory drug testing is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989), and Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).

2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
   – Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, random drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
   – Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
   – “Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 754–55; Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
   – Massachusetts bars “excessive bail” and conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Forcing Petitioner to choose between discontinuing essential treatment (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (risking detention) is excessive.

D. The Conditions Violate Fourteenth Amendment Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
1. Substantive Due Process—Bodily Integrity  
   – Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
   – Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
   – Requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  
   – The District Court issued no such findings.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  
   – MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). MERA must be construed liberally. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
   – Section 58 requires “the least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
   – The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. See Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief and Injunctive-Relief Factors  
   – Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5.  
   – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008) requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced cessation of essential medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—enforcing disability rights and equal access to justice is paramount.

H. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Pre-Trial Punishment  
   – Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6. The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
