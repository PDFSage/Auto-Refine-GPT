COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two District Court conditions imposed September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.

Those conditions deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a)); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  
• § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero‐Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004)).  
• Mass. Equal Rights Act (G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004)).  
• Fourth Amendment/Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001)).  
• Eighth Amendment/Art. 26; Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017)).  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive/procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)).  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).

No other timely remedy exists; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• September 26, 2024: Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
• July 17, 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies relief without findings.  
• December 2, 2025: Trial scheduled; without relief, harm continues daily.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) that confirms only micro-dosed amphetamine controls his symptoms. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random testing with no medical or risk findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Whether a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” without individualized findings, violates the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due process.  
2. Whether suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
3. Whether these conditions are an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II & § 504 VIOLATIONS  
1. Coverage. Bail and pre-trial release are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Calero‐Cerezo, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Unlawful Blanket Exclusion. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b) requires evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration before excluding prescribed medication. Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket medication bans.  
3. Stereotypes Forbidden. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) prohibits reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes.”

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS  
Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001). Without individualized suspicion or special-needs justification, suspicionless testing is unconstitutional. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2016).  

C. EXCESSIVE BAIL CLAUSE VIOLATIONS  
“Liberty is the norm.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential medication—or non-compliance and detention—are “excessive.”

D. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS  
1. Substantive. Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018).  
2. Procedural. Due process demands written, specific findings balancing the State’s interest against medical necessity. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). None were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758 (1997).

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 ABUSE OF DISCRETION  
Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020). The court made no risk findings and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108 (1990).

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible harm (Riggins at 134–35); (3) balance—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punitive.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
