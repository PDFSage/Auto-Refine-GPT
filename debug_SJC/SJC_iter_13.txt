COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  • A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  • Mandatory suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They thus violate:  

  1. Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132[1], and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139[4];  
  2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794[7];  
  3. Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103[19];  
  4. Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments; Articles 14, 26, 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
  5. G. L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement[11].  

No alternative remedy exists. Immediate superintendence relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm to Petitioner’s cognitive, psychological, and vocational well-being.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002)[15]. When no other adequate remedy exists, relief lies under G. L. c. 211, § 3. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4-5 (July 17, 2025)[25].

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
  • 26 Sep 2024 – Woburn District Court sets bail, imposing the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025 – Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025. No timely or adequate alternative relief exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH, Exhibit 1) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel submitted Petitioner’s valid prescription and current medical evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random testing without any medical, behavioral, or threat-risk inquiry.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due process?  
  2. Does mandatory suspicionless urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  

  1. Title II/§ 504 Cover Pre-Trial Release Conditions  
    – Title II bars any “public entity” from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from its “programs or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132[1]; 29 U.S.C. § 794[7].  
    – Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004)[2]; Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004)[6].  

  2. Denial of Required Individualized Assessment  
    – DOJ regulations require a case‐by‐case inquiry before excluding disability‐related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7)[4], 35.139(a)[24]; Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999)[3]; Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014)[5].  
    – Here the court imposed a per se ban on “any illegal drugs,” foreclosing Petitioner’s only effective treatment—micro-dosed amphetamine—without any inquiry.  

  3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Per Se Unlawful  
    – Exclusion of prescribed medication requires evidence‐based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or will “fundamentally alter” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024)[35].  
    – Federal courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019)[40]; Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018)[41]; Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019)[42].  
    – The U.S. DOJ-Mass. Trial Court 2022 Settlement similarly bars pre-trial blanket bans.[9]  

  4. Reliance on “Myths, Fears, and Stereotypes” Is Forbidden  
    – Congress prohibited reliance on stereotypes in disability contexts. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7)[33]. No findings here link micro-dosed amphetamine to risk.  

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  

  1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search  
    – Drug testing constitutes a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989)[43]; Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001)[44].  

  2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
    – Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs showing, suspicionless tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995)[16]; Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997)[17].  
    – Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016)[45].  

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  

  – “Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987)[12]; Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951)[27].  
  – Massachusetts bars “excessive bail.” Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017)[14].  
  – Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (risking detention) are “excessive.”  

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  

  1. Substantive Due Process—Bodily Integrity  
    – Detainees have a liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990)[30]; Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992)[31]; Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003)[32].  
    – Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected liberty interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996)[17]; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018)[17].  

  2. Procedural Due Process  
    – Requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s treatment need against any legitimate interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976)[33]; Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973)[16]; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979)[13].  
    – No such findings were made.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act  

  – MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” G. L. c. 93, § 103[19]. Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004)[29]. MERA is to be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997)[37].  

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  

  – Section 58 requires the “least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016)[26]; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020)[28].  
  – The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017)[38]; Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990)[38].  

G. Extraordinary Superintendence and Injunctive-Relief Standards  

  – Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders substantially infringing rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005)[18]; Jones, slip op. at 4–5[25].  
  – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)[37], requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—enforcing disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  

  – Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions function as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
