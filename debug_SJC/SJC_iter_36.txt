COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), invokes this Court’s superintendence power to VACATE two pre-trial conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court (Docket No. 5531568; Sept. 26, 2024):  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, in direct conflict with:  
  • Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regs (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a));  
     – Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999)  
  • § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero‐Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004)  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock v. DOC, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004)  
  • Fourth Amendment/Art. 14: Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001)  
  • Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail Clause: United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017)  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive/procedural due process: Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018)  
  • G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail-condition standard: Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  

Absent immediate relief, Petitioner will suffer irreparable cognitive and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate a bail order infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); see Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025—Trial scheduled; no other timely remedy exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers severe dopamine‐deficit ADHD, confirmed by an October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his cognition and behavior. Despite submission of a valid prescription and expert evidence at arraignment, the District Court banned “any illegal drugs” (sweeping in legal medications) and mandated random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Whether a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due process.  
2. Whether suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
3. Whether these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Title II and § 504 Cover Bail and Pre-Trial Release. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).  
2. Denial of Reasonable Modification. DOJ regs require individualized assessment before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes, 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court’s per se drug ban foreclosed Petitioner’s only effective treatment.  
3. Blanket Bans Are Unlawful. Exclusion of prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings of a direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar policies: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Mass. Trial Court Settlement likewise prohibits blanket pre-trial medication bans.  
4. Stereotypes Forbidden. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) bars reliance on myths about disability; no findings link amphetamine to flight risk.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14  
1. Search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617; Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78.  
2. Unreasonable Without Suspicion. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26  
Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions coercing medication cessation (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are excessive.

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural Due Process. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). No findings were made.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person (G.L. c. 93, § 103). Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no risk findings and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescriptions, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence & Injunctive-Relief Standards  
A Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992)); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; and (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
