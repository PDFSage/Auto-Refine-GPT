COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, a pre-trial detainee in Woburn District Court (Docket No. 5531568), seeks superintendence relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3. On September 26, 2024, the District Court imposed two conditions of release: (1) a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and (2) random urinalysis. These conditions violate:  

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132;  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
• Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments;  
• Articles 14, 26, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
• G. L. c. 276, § 58 (least-restrictive bail standard).  

Petitioner has severe dopamine-deficit ADHD controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1: Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH, Oct 2024 neuropsychological report). The court made no individualized findings that his medication poses a direct threat or fundamentally alters the bail process. This Court’s extraordinary power must intervene to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may review bail and related conditions infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G. L. c. 211, § 3 applies. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
• 26 Sep 2024: Arraignment on one count of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A; challenged release conditions imposed.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denied review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025. No timely or adequate alternative remedy exists.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does such a ban, and mandatory random drug testing, constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, calling for superintendence relief?

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Paragraphs 7–16 of the Superior Court draft are incorporated verbatim. In summary: Petitioner has well-documented ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. He has presented current medical evidence and a prescription. The District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random testing, without medical or threat-risk findings.  

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  

1. Title II and § 504 Apply to Pre-Trial Release.  
   – Title II bars a “public entity” from denying qualified individuals the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities” it offers. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; see Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004) (judicial processes are covered “programs”); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  

2. Denial of Reasonable Modification.  
   – The District Court imposed a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” precluding Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a) require an “individualized assessment” before excluding an accommodation. See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
   – A per se exclusion of necessary medication violates Title II absent direct-threat or fundamental-alteration findings. Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024); Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). The U.S. Department of Justice’s 2022 Settlement Agreement with the Massachusetts Trial Court forbids such blanket bans in pre-trial settings.  

3. No Direct-Threat or Fundamental-Alteration Showing.  
   – Before excluding prescribed medication, a public entity must find, on current medical evidence, that it poses a “direct threat” or would “fundamentally alter” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b). Reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” is expressly prohibited. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).  
   – Here, the District Court made no medical or factual findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence. The ban is therefore unlawful.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  

1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search.  
   – Compulsory urine testing is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989), and Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  

2. Unreasonable Without Individualized Justification.  
   – Suspicionless drug tests require individualized suspicion or a special-needs showing. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997). The District Court articulated neither. Massachusetts law demands reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  

   – “Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
   – Massachusetts bars “excessive bail,” including unduly restrictive conditions. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing either noncompliance (and detention) or cessation of essential treatment are excessive.

D. Substantive and Procedural Fourteenth-Amendment Due Process  

1. Substantive Due Process – Bodily Integrity.  
   – A detainee has a substantive liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003). Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process.  
   – Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interest against the individual’s right to treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973). Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. Violation of the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  

   – MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. Denying access to the only effective medication is per se discrimination. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). MERA is to be construed liberally. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  

   – Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
   – The court made no findings linking micro-dosing to nonappearance or danger. Less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers—were never considered. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Under G. L. c. 211, § 3  

   – A Single Justice may vacate orders that cause “substantial infringement of a substantive right.” Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Jones, slip op. at 4–5.

H. Injunctive-Relief Factors (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008))  

   – Likelihood of success: overwhelming on multiple statutory and constitutional grounds.  
   – Irreparable harm: forced cessation of treatment causes irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992).  
   – Balance of harms: public safety is better served by stable treatment; forced discontinuation heightens relapse risk and impulsivity.  
   – Public interest: ensuring equal access to justice and compliance with disability law is paramount.

I. Presumption of Innocence  

   – Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
   1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
   2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine, coupled with less-restrictive monitoring;  
   3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
   4. GRANT any further relief this Court deems just, including expedited consideration to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm.
