COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. Introduction  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks superintendence relief under G.L. c. 211, § 3 to vacate two pre-trial conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):  

  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:

• Deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—thus violating Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a));  
• Contravene Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
• Breach the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103;  
• Infringe the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Violate the Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26 (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
• Deny Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
• Flout G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” standard (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).

No adequate remedy exists in the trial court or on appeal; immediate intervention is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. Jurisdiction  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy is available, G.L. c. 211, § 3 provides the exclusive superintendence mechanism. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. Procedural History  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions at arraignment.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without written findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025: Trial scheduled; absence of relief guarantees daily irreparable harm.

IV. Statement of Facts  
Petitioner suffers severe dopamine-deficit ADHD diagnosed October 2024 by Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his functioning (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel proffered Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert medical evidence. Despite this, the District Court imposed a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” (including Petitioner’s prescribed amphetamine) and suspicionless random urinalysis, without any individualized medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. Questions Presented  
1. Does a blanket ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without any individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. Argument  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Title II/§ 504 Apply to Bail and Pre-Trial Release. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Denial of Reasonable Modification. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) require a case-by-case inquiry before excluding necessary medication. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban on amphetamine, Petitioner’s sole effective treatment, denies meaningful access.  
3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b) mandates findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. 2019). The DOJ’s 2022 Massachusetts Trial Court Settlement likewise bars such bans.  
4. Stereotypes Forbidden. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) prohibits reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” No evidence links micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
1. Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Suspicionless testing is unreasonable absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Art. 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance and detention are “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Fourteenth Amendment Due Process  
1. Substantive. Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural. Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interest against the need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were made.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Section 58 requires bail conditions to be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and community safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence & Injunctive-Relief Standards  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible harm (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety; and (4) public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions function as punishment, not regulation.

VII. Relief Requested  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
