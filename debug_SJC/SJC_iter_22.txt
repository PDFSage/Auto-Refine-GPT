COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two September 26, 2024 conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court (No. 5531568):  
  1. a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  

  • Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139 (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004);  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004);  
  • Fourth Amendment/Art. 14 rights against unreasonable search; Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001);  
  • Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 rights against excessive bail or conditions; United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017);  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618 (1996);  
  • G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard; Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020).  

Absent intervention, Petitioner will suffer irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; no timely or adequate alternative remedy exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers from severe ADHD, diagnosed in October 2024 by Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his symptoms (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel submitted Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert report. Nonetheless, the District Court imposed a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without any medical or threat-risk findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II, § 504, MERA, and due process?  
  2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars any public entity from excluding qualified disabled individuals from its “programs” (42 U.S.C. § 12132); Section 504 parallels (29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d 6). Judicial processes—including bail—are “programs” under Title II (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509; Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058; Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206).  
2. Failure to Provide Reasonable Modification: DOJ regulations require an “individualized assessment” before excluding necessary medication (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581; Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136). The court here imposed a per se ban on amphetamine without inquiry.  
3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful: Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration (28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies (Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41; Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35; Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222). DOJ’s 2022 Settlement with the Mass. Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket bans.  
4. Reliance on Stereotypes Is Prohibited: Congress found “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” is harmful (42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7)). No evidence supports excluding micro-dosed amphetamine.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
1. Random urinalysis is a search (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602; Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67).  
2. Suspicionless testing is unreasonable without individualized suspicion or special-needs justification (Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646; Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305; Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/ART. 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL  
Liberty is the norm; restraint is the exception (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739; Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1). Massachusetts bars “excessive bail,” including conditions tantamount to detention (Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691). These conditions force either discontinuation of essential treatment (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention)—both “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210; Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127; Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166; Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90).  
2. Procedural: At minimum, due process requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against the need for treatment (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319; Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520). No findings were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory (Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844); MERA must be liberally construed (Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758).

F. ABUSE OF DISCRETION UNDER G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Bail conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety (Diggs, 475 Mass. 79; Lougee, 485 Mass. 70). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers (Peterson, 476 Mass. 163; Durling, 407 Mass. 108).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTION STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing fundamental rights (Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra). The Winter factors (555 U.S. 7 (2008)) favor Petitioner:  
  • Likelihood of success—overwhelming statutory and constitutional violations;  
  • Irreparable harm—forced cessation of essential medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35);  
  • Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
  • Public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction (Bell, 441 U.S. 520; Stack, 342 U.S. 1). The challenged conditions operate as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
