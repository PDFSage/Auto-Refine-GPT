VI. ARGUMENT

A. The Blanket Drug Ban and Random Testing Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

1. Title II and § 504 Apply to Pre-Trial Release Conditions  
   – Title II forbids a “public entity” from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from its “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Bail and pre-trial supervision are “program[s]” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504’s standards “parallel” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).

2. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Modification  
   – A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without any individualized inquiry, denies meaningful access to pre-trial liberty where the only effective treatment is proscribed. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a) require an “individualized assessment” before excluding necessary medication. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
   – Blanket exclusions violate Title II absent a direct-threat or fundamental-alteration finding. Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024); accord Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). The DOJ-Mass. Trial Court 2022 Settlement expressly prohibits such blanket bans in pre-trial contexts.

3. No Evidence of Direct Threat or Fundamental Alteration  
   – To justify excluding a prescribed medication, 28 C.F.R. § 35.139 mandates evidence-based findings that it poses a direct threat or fundamentally alters the program. See R.B. v. Bd. of Trustees, 30 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2022). Here, the court made no findings, medical or factual, that micro-dosed amphetamine increases flight risk or violence. Absent such findings, the ban is per se unlawful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) (prohibiting reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes”).

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14

1. Random Urinalysis Is a “Search”  
   – Drug screening is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989), and Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).

2. Unreasonable Without Individualized Justification  
   – Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs showing, suspicionless drug tests are unconstitutional. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997). Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause

   – Pre-trial liberty is the norm; restraint is the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). Massachusetts likewise bars “excessive” bail and conditions. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions that force either non-compliance (and detention) or cessation of essential treatment are “excessive” and unconstitutional.

D. Substantive and Procedural Due Process Protections of Bodily Integrity

1. Substantive Due Process  
   – An individual has a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003). Massachusetts recognizes this interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
   – Due process requires at least written, specific findings balancing state interests against the individual’s right to treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973). The District Court issued no findings. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).

E. Violation of the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103

   – MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. Denying access to lawfully prescribed medication is discriminatory per se. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). MERA is to be “construed liberally.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58

   – Section 58 demands the “least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure appearance and community safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosing to risk. Less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers—were never considered. See Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Under G. L. c. 211, § 3

   – A Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

H. Injunction Standards (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008))

   – (1) Likelihood of success: overwhelming.  
   – (2) Irreparable harm: discontinuation of essential treatment inflicts cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35.  
   – (3) Balance of equities: stable treatment promotes public safety; forced cessation increases risk of relapse or impulsivity.  
   – (4) Public interest: ensuring compliance with disability rights and equal access to justice is paramount.

I. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Punishment

   – Pre-trial defendants “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6. Categorical drug bans and random searches operate as punishment, not regulation.

-----------------------------------------

This complete, case-law–rich argument demonstrates that the District Court’s categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and mandate of random urinalysis infringe multiple federal and state constitutional, statutory, and common-law rights and constitute an abuse of discretion warranting superintendence relief.
