VI. ARGUMENT

A. The Blanket Drug Ban and Random Testing Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
  1. Title II and § 504 Cover Pre-Trial Release Conditions  
     • 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794; 28 C.F.R. § 35.102.  
     • Bail and pre-trial supervision are “program[s]” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
  2. Denial of Reasonable Modification  
     • 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) require individualized assessment of disability-related medication before exclusion. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
     • A per se ban on “any illegal drugs” precludes Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—micro-dosed amphetamine—without any inquiry.  
  3. Blanket Exclusions Are Per Se Unlawful Absent Direct-Threat Findings  
     • 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b) mandates evidence-based findings that the accommodation would pose a direct threat or fundamentally alter the program. Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
     • Federal courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court likewise prohibits pre-trial blanket medication bans.  
  4. No Direct-Threat or Fundamental-Alteration Evidence  
     • The District Court made no medical or factual findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence, relying on forbidden “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
  1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search  
     • Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
  2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
     • Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs justification, random drug screens violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
     • Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
  • “Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
  • Massachusetts prohibits “excessive bail” or conditions that effectively coerce detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing Petitioner to cease essential treatment (risking decompensation) or to violate the ban (risking detention) are excessive.

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
  1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy  
     • Forced withdrawal of prescribed medication offends substantive due process. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
     • Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected liberty interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).  
  2. Procedural Due Process  
     • Due process requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s treatment needs against government interests. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court made no such findings.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  
  • MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to lawfully prescribed medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
  • MERA is to be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
  • Bail conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and public safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
  • The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. See Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief Under G. L. c. 211, § 3  
  • A Single Justice may vacate an order that substantially infringes constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

H. Injunctive-Relief Factors Favor Immediate Relief (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008))  
  1. Likelihood of success: overwhelming on ADA/§ 504, constitutional, MERA, and § 58 grounds.  
  2. Irreparable harm: withdrawal of essential medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35.  
  3. Balance of harms: stable treatment promotes public safety; forced cessation heightens risk of relapse or impulsivity.  
  4. Public interest: enforcing disability rights and equal access to justice is paramount.

I. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Punishment  
  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6. The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.
