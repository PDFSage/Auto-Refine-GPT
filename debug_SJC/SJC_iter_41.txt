COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL  
PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks this Court’s superintendence power, G.L. c. 211, § 3, to VACATE two conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

Those conditions:  
  • Deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, in violation of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, implementing regs 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139 (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
  • Contravene § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
  • Breach the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
  • Impose unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
  • Inflict “excessive” bail and conditions under the Eighth Amendment, Art. 26 of the MDOR, and G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” standard (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017)); and  
  • Violate substantive and procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Arts. 12, 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)).  

No adequate remedy exists below; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm to Petitioner’s health, cognition, and ability to participate in his defense.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 provides the exclusive superintendence vehicle. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • 2 Dec 2025—Trial scheduled; Petitioner remains subject to unconstitutional conditions.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s Oct. 2024 neuropsychology report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert evidence. Nonetheless, the District Court imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” (including Petitioner’s prescribed medication) and random urinalysis without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Whether a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees.  
  2. Whether suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
  3. Whether these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. Title II of the ADA & § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
  1. Coverage: Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified disabled persons from “programs” they offer. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004). Bail and pre-trial supervision are “programs.” Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).  
  2. Reasonable Modification Required: DOJ regulations mandate an individualized inquiry before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban forecloses Petitioner’s only effective ADHD therapy.  
  3. Blanket Bans Unlawful: Excluding prescribed medication demands specific, evidence-based findings that it poses a direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined analogous bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Massachusetts Trial Court settlement bars blanket medication prohibitions.  
  4. Stereotypes Forbidden: Congress prohibited reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. Fourth Amendment & Art. 14  
  • Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67 (2001).  
  • Without individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, suspicionless drug tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Chandler, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2016).

C. Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail  
  • “Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691 (2017).  
  • Conditions forcing discontinuation of essential treatment (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process  
  1. Substantive Liberty: Detainees have a protected right to refuse forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018).  
  2. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the need for treatment. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); Bell, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). None were issued.

E. Maine Equal Rights Act Violation  
  • MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758 (1997).

F. Abuse of Discretion Under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
  • Conditions must be the least restrictive means to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020).  
  • The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108 (1990).

G. Superintendence & Injunction Standards  
  • Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra.  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992)); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety; (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1 (1951). The challenged conditions are punitive, not regulatory.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner Bo Shang respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
