COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks this Court’s superintendence power, G.L. c. 211, § 3, to vacate two pre-trial conditions imposed September 26, 2024 (Woburn Dkt. No. 5531568):  

1. A blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:

• Deny Petitioner his only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, in violation of Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and DOJ regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a)) (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
• Contravene § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
• Breach the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
• Authorize an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Impose “excessive” bail conditions contrary to the Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 and G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017); Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016)); and  
• Violate substantive and procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Arts. 12, 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979)).  

No adequate remedy exists below. Immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm to Petitioner’s cognitive, psychological, and vocational functioning.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail or release-condition orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 provides the exclusive superintendence avenue. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• September 26, 2024 – Woburn District Court (No. 5531568) imposes the challenged conditions.  
• July 17, 2025 – Middlesex Superior Court denies relief without factual or legal findings.  
• December 2, 2025 – Trial set. Absent relief, Petitioner endures ongoing, irreparable injury.

IV. FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert medical evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” (sweeping in his prescription) and required random, suspicionless urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or “direct threat” findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does mandatory suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II & SECTION 504: DENIAL OF REASONABLE MODIFICATION  
1. Bail and pre-trial release are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010). Section 504 coextensively prohibits exclusion of qualified individuals. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. DOJ regs (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a)) require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes, 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court’s per se ban on amphetamine forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment without inquiry.  
3. Blanket bans violate Title II absent direct-threat or fundamental-alteration findings. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, *12–13 (1st Cir. 2024). Courts nationwide have enjoined analogous policies (Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019)). The 2022 DOJ–Massachusetts Trial Court settlement bars blanket pre-trial bans.  
4. Reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is forbidden. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14: UNREASONABLE SEARCH  
Random, suspicionless urinalysis is a Fourth Amendment “search.” Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001). Absent individualized suspicion or a “special needs” showing, it is unreasonable. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive Liberty: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing state interests and medical necessity. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58—“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”  
Conditions must be the least restrictive means to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  1. Likelihood of success—overwhelming here;  
  2. Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992));  
  3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety; and  
  4. Public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punishment, not regulatory safeguards.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
