COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two September 26, 2024 District Court conditions (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  
These conditions (a) deny his only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  

  • Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
  • § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
  • Fourth Amendment/Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
  • Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
  • G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement (Diggs v. Commonwealth, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No adequate alternative remedy exists; immediate superintendence relief is required to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights under G.L. c. 211, § 3. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other remedy suffices, this power extends to pre-trial release conditions. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
• 26 Sep 2024: District Court imposes conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH documents severe dopamine-deficit ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel proffered the prescription and expert evidence. The court nonetheless imposed the blanket drug ban and random testing absent any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Bail and pre-trial supervision are “programs” under Title II. Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19–20.  
2. Reasonable Modification: 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603; Nunes, 766 F.3d at 143–44. A per se ban on amphetamine denies Petitioner’s only effective treatment.  
3. Blanket Bans Prohibited: Excluding necessary medication demands evidence-based findings of a direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Settlement with the Mass. Trial Court bars blanket pre-trial bans.  
4. No Stereotypes: Congress forbade reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No evidence links micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. at 617; Ferguson, 532 U.S. at 77–78. Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/ART. 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno, 481 U.S. at 754–55; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. at 698–700. Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: A detainee has a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. at 626–27; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural: Due process demands written, specific findings balancing state interests against the need for treatment. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to Petitioner’s only effective medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. at 851–52; Bain, 424 Mass. at 766–67.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58—LEAST RESTRICTIVE  
Conditions must be the least restrictive necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation causes irreversible harm (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions are punitive, not regulatory.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
