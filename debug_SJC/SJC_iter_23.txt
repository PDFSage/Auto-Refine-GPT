COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang challenges two pre-trial release conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court (Dkt. No. 5531568; Sept. 26, 2024):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.

These conditions (a) deny a reasonable accommodation for Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  
  • Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139 (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999));  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004));  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004));  
  • Fourth Amendment/Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.' Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001));  
  • Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017));  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive & procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003));  
  • G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” pre-trial release standard (Diggs v. Commonwealth, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020)).

No adequate remedy exists in the trial court or on appeal; immediate superintendence relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
G.L. c. 211, § 3 empowers a Single Justice to vacate bail orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no adequate remedy exists, this extraordinary writ is appropriate. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court (No. 5531568) imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; absent relief, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm.

IV. FACTUAL SUMMARY  
Petitioner suffers severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH). Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his functioning. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert evidence. The District Court nevertheless imposed a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. ARGUMENT

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified individuals from “programs” it offers, including bail and pre-trial supervision. Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998); Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Individualized Assessment Required: 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) mandate case-by-case analysis of disability-related medication before exclusion. Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581, 603; Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court foreclosed Petitioner’s only effective treatment without inquiry.  
3. Blanket Bans Prohibited: Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based direct-threat or fundamental-alteration findings. Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024); Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018). The 2022 DOJ/Massachusetts Trial Court Settlement bans blanket pre-trial medication prohibitions.  
4. No Reliance on Stereotypes: 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) forbids reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. No evidence links micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
Random, suspicionless urinalysis is a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.' Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001). Absent individualized suspicion or a “special needs” showing, suspicionless tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT, ART. 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural: Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against Petitioner’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). No findings were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to the only effective medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 (“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”)  
Bail conditions must be the least restrictive necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  • Likelihood of success—overwhelming statutory and constitutional violations;  
  • Irreparable harm—forced cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35);  
  • Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
  • Public interest—ensuring compliance with disability laws and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
