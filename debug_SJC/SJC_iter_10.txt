COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3 to vacate two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  • A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  • Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1)—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  

  • Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and implementing regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139);  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
  • Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and Articles 14, 26, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
  • G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary.  

No other adequate remedy exists; immediate relief is needed to prevent irreparable cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
  • A Single Justice may review bail and related conditions infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002).  
  • When no other adequate remedy is available, G. L. c. 211, § 3 provides relief. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).  

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: District Court enters pre-trial release conditions challenged herein.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.  

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
  2. Does mandatory suspicionless testing violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?  

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner has been diagnosed with severe ADHD by the Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Oct 2024 neuropsychological report, Exhibit 1). Decades of treatment history confirm that only micro-dosed amphetamine affords him stable cognitive function. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert report. Nevertheless, the District Court imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
  1. Title II/§ 504 Cover Pre-Trial Release.  
     • 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
     • Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).  
     • Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  

  2. Denial of Reasonable Modification.  
     • 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) require an individualized assessment before excluding necessary medication. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
     • A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment absent any inquiry.

  3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful Without Direct-Threat Findings.  
     • 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b) mandates evidence-based findings that the accommodation would pose a direct threat or fundamentally alter the program. Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
     • Courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
     • The U.S. DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket medication prohibitions.  

  4. Reliance on “Myths, Fears, and Stereotypes” Is Forbidden.  
     • 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No findings here link micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
  1. Random Urinalysis Is a “Search.”  
     • Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  

  2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable.  
     • Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
     • Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
  • “Liberty is the norm”; pre-trial restraint is the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
  • Massachusetts prohibits “excessive” bail or conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017).  

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
  1. Substantive Due Process — Bodily Integrity.  
     • Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
     • Massachusetts recognizes a right to medical autonomy. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).  

  2. Procedural Due Process.  
     • Requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against government interests. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  
     • No such findings were made.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  
  • Prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
  • MERA must be construed liberally. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
  • Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
  • The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives (verified prescriptions, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers). Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief and Injunctive Standards  
  • Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing fundamental rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5.  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
    1. Likelihood of success on the merits—overwhelming here;  
    2. Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive and psychological injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35;  
    3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
    4. Public interest—enforcing disability law and equal access to justice is paramount.

H. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Pre-Trial Punishment  
  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT such further relief as justice requires, including expedited consideration to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm.
