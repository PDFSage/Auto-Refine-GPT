COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two District Court conditions imposed September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):  

1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) prohibit Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of threat or risk. They violate:

• Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act;  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act;  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14;  
• Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26;  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard.

Immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 applies. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies relief without findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025—Trial scheduled. No other timely remedy can avert ongoing harm.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD controlled only by micro-dosed amphetamine (Ex. 1). At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed (1) a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and (2) random drug testing without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA AND § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage. Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified disabled persons from “programs.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 parallels. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004). Bail and pre-trial release are “programs.” Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).  

2. Reasonable Modification Required. DOJ regs mandate an “individualized assessment” before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court’s per se ban forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment without any inquiry.  

3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful. Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings of a “direct threat” or that the accommodation would “fundamentally alter” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined analogous policies:  
   • Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019);  
   • Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018);  
   • Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
The DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court likewise bars blanket pre-trial medication prohibitions.[9]  

4. Myths and Stereotypes Forbidden. Congress found reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). The District Court made no evidence-based findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to any risk.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT AND ART. 14  
1. Random urinalysis is a “search.” Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Absent individualized suspicion or a “special needs” justification, suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).  

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL AND ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment (risking mental decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”  

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy. Pre-trial detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. U.S., 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural Due Process. Requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the detainee’s medical needs. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
MERA forbids disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58—LEAST RESTRICTIVE  
Bail conditions must be the least restrictive necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe fundamental rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  1. Likelihood of success—overwhelming here;  
  2. Irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992));  
  3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
  4. Public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions serve punitive ends, not regulatory purposes.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
