COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

Those conditions:  
  • Deny Petitioner the only effective treatment for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, in violation of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
  • Contravene Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
  • Breach the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dept. of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
  • Violate the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
  • Offend the Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26 (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
  • Infringe substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
  • Contravene G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No adequate alternative remedy exists; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm to Petitioner’s cognitive, psychological, and vocational functioning.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 furnishes the exclusive superintendence remedy. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4-5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
  • September 26, 2024 – Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions at arraignment (Docket No. 5531568).  
  • July 17, 2025 – Middlesex Superior Court denies review without written findings.  
  • December 2, 2025 – Trial scheduled.  

No appeal or other post-conviction process can avert the daily, irreparable harm inflicted by forced medication cessation.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation at Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. Exhibit 1. At arraignment, counsel submitted Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert medical evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed (1) a total ban on “any illegal drugs,” thereby prohibiting Petitioner’s prescribed medication, and (2) random, suspicionless urinalysis, without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Whether a categorical prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without any individualized findings, violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, and due-process guarantees.  
  2. Whether mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
  3. Whether these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Title II/§ 504 Apply to Pre-Trial Release Conditions. The ADA bars public entities from denying qualified individuals the benefits of their programs. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).  
2. Denial of Reasonable Modification. DOJ regulations mandate an “individualized assessment” before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). Here, the court applied a per se ban on amphetamine—Petitioner’s sole effective therapy—without any inquiry.  
3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Per Se Unlawful. To exclude prescribed medication, the entity must make evidence-based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or will “fundamentally alter” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 Massachusetts Trial Court settlement likewise bars blanket pre-trial medication prohibitions.  
4. Reliance on Stereotypes Is Prohibited. Congress found that “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). The District Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to any threat.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14  
1. Random Urinalysis Is a “Search.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Unreasonable Without Suspicion. Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification, suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing discontinuation of essential medication—or non-compliance and detention—are “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Fourteenth Amendment Due Process  
1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy. Pre-trial detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural Due Process. Requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to Petitioner’s only effective medication is per se discriminatory.

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Section 58 requires bail conditions be the least restrictive necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence and Injunctive-Relief Standards  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  1. Likelihood of success—overwhelming here on ADA, constitutional, and statutory grounds;  
  2. Irreparable harm—forced cessation of essential medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992));  
  3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety; and  
  4. Public interest—ensuring compliance with disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to prescribe a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
