COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner challenges two conditions imposed September 26, 2024 by the Woburn District Court (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny a reasonable accommodation for Petitioner’s severe ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and DOJ regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139);  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794);  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (G.L. c. 93, § 103);  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26 (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No other remedy is adequate; without relief Petitioner will suffer irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate a bail order that substantially infringes constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• 26 Sep 2024: District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) confirms severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment counsel submitted the prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without medical or threat-risk findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Do these conditions violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due process?  
2. Do they infringe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights?  
3. Are they an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT

A. ADA AND REHABILITATION ACT VIOLATIONS  
1. Coverage: Bail and pre-trial release are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Individualized Assessment Required: 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) prohibit blanket exclusions of disability-related medication. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
3. Blanket Bans Unlawful: Per se exclusions demand specific, evidence-based “direct threat” or “fundamental alteration” findings. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); DOJ-Trial Court Settlement (2022).  
4. Stereotypes Prohibited: Congress barred reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS  
1. Random testing is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617; Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78.  
2. Unreasonable absent suspicion. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53; Chandler, 520 U.S. 305, 319; Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EXCESSIVE BAIL VIOLATIONS  
“Liberty is the norm,” restraint the exception. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6; Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700. Conditions forcing either decompensation or detention are “excessive.”

D. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31; Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36; Sell, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80; Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04.  
2. Procedural: Due process requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against medical necessity. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35; Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91; Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37. None were made.

E. MERA VIOLATION  
MERA forbids disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52; Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 ABUSE OF DISCRETION  
Bail conditions must be least restrictive. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89; Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77. The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescriptions, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73; Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13.

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTION STANDARDS  
G.L. c. 211, § 3 empowers a Single Justice to vacate orders infringing fundamental rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Under Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, Petitioner shows:  
  • Likelihood of success—overwhelming;  
  • Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation causes irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35);  
  • Balance—stable treatment promotes safety;  
  • Public interest—upholding disability rights and access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests this Court to:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to fashion a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
