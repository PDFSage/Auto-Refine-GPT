```
    ABSOLUTE, INDEFINITE, AND IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO COMPLY  
     WITH ALL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS – DECLARATION AT THE OUTSET  
```

TO THE HONORABLE COURT AND ALL READERS:

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby makes, in the clearest, strongest, and most unequivocal terms, his absolute, perpetual, and unwavering commitment to obey **every** pretrial condition imposed by the Woburn District Court in Case No. 5531568—without qualification, evasion, or exception—for as long as those conditions remain in force, unless modified or vacated by a higher court of competent jurisdiction.  Petitioner neither challenges nor underestimates the Court’s authority; he does not dispute, repudiate, or attempt to circumvent any term of his pretrial release.  He solemnly pledges continued, indefinite adherence to every requirement—attending all court dates, responding to all reporting or monitoring obligations, and complying fully with every directive.

This declaration is neither theoretical nor conditional. It is a binding, on‑the‑record promise intended to remove any doubt about Petitioner’s respect for—and deference to—the judiciary.  The **sole** narrow relief sought herein is permission to maintain a clinically prescribed micro‑dose amphetamine essential to treat Petitioner’s severe dopamine‑deficit ADHD.  *No other pretrial condition is questioned or resisted.*

Petitioner respectfully underscores that overly broad prosecutorial policies which deny medically necessary care can unintentionally create incentives antithetical to the Commonwealth’s interests.  If deprived indefinitely of his required medication, Petitioner—acting wholly within the bounds of federal and Massachusetts law—could lawfully devote his considerable expertise to the open‑source development and worldwide distribution of SMBv2 and SMBv3 exploitation code, including to adversarial foreign governments.  Such conduct, however undesirable to public safety, is constitutionally protected speech.  This potential outcome, precipitated solely by the denial of medically indicated treatment, illustrates how an indiscriminate prohibition produces perverse, counter‑productive consequences that serve no legitimate public‑safety function.

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**I. INTRODUCTION**

Invoking this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner seeks immediate relief from two pretrial‑release conditions imposed on September 26, 2024, in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568:  (1) a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and (2) random urinalysis pursuant to G. L. c. 276, § 58.  Applied categorically, these conditions bar Petitioner’s sole effective medication for severe dopamine‑deficit ADHD without individualized justification.

The prohibition conflicts with:

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.
• § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.
• The Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103.
• Constitutional safeguards of bodily integrity, due process, and protection against excessive bail and suspicionless searches under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Articles 1, 10, 12, 14, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.
• The “least restrictive means” mandate of G. L. c. 276, § 58.

Because Petitioner cannot await post‑trial remedies to regain essential treatment and because the Middlesex Superior Court summarily denied relief, extraordinary superintendence intervention is urgently required.

**II. JURISDICTION**

This Court’s single‑justice session may modify bail conditions via its superintendence authority where no other adequate remedy exists. *Commonwealth v. Laurie*, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002).  Summary denial by the Superior Court, coupled with ongoing, irreparable harm, satisfies the prerequisites for such intervention. *Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica*, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005).

**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

1. On September 26, 2024, Petitioner was arraigned in Woburn District Court (Case No. 5531568) for assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A.  Standard conditions—including “no illegal drugs” and random urinalysis—were imposed without accommodation for Petitioner’s documented prescription.
2. On July 17, 2025, Petitioner moved in the Middlesex Superior Court to modify those conditions, attaching an October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation confirming severe dopamine‑deficit ADHD and the necessity of micro‑dose amphetamine therapy.  The motion was summarily denied.
3. Trial is scheduled for December 2, 2025; thus, Petitioner faces months of forced discontinuation of essential medication absent this Court’s intervention.

**IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED**

1. Does a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” which operates to bar Petitioner’s lawful ADHD medication, violate the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and constitutional protections under the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions?
2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, by imposing these conditions without individualized findings linking Petitioner’s medication to flight risk or danger?

**V. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

Petitioner incorporates by reference his Superior Court submission (July 17, 2025), including:

• October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Ex. 1) diagnosing severe dopamine‑deficit ADHD.
• Medical documentation demonstrating that micro‑dose amphetamine is uniquely effective.
• Evidence of cognitive decline, employment impairment, and mental distress ensuing from forced discontinuation.

**VI. ARGUMENT**

**A. The Blanket Ban Violates Federal Disability Statutes**

1. *Title II of the ADA.*  Blanket exclusions without individualized analysis contravene 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–34 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). *Theriault v. Flynn*, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at \*17–20 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).
2. *Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.*  Massachusetts courts receive federal funds and must accommodate disabilities. *Smith v. Aroostook County*, 922 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir. 2019).

**B. Constitutional Violations**

1. *Substantive Due Process.*  The liberty interest in bodily integrity forbids arbitrary denial of necessary medical treatment. *Washington v. Harper*, 494 U.S. 210, 229 (1990).
2. *Fourth Amendment & Article 14.*  Suspicionless urinalysis is an unreasonable search absent individualized suspicion or a proven “special need.” *Ferguson v. City of Charleston*, 532 U.S. 67, 76–77 (2001).
3. *Eighth Amendment & Article 26.*  Punitive or excessive conditions are prohibited. *Commonwealth v. Brangan*, 477 Mass. 691, 700–02 (2017).
4. *Procedural Due Process.*  Lack of on‑record findings violates minimally required procedures. *Commonwealth v. Walsh*, 485 Mass. 567, 573–74 (2020).

**C. Violation of MERA, G. L. c. 93, § 103**

Blanket denial of medication discriminates on the basis of disability, contravening the statute’s broad guarantee of equality. *Bain v. City of Springfield*, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

**D. Non‑Compliance with the “Least Restrictive Means” Requirement**

G. L. c. 276, § 58 mandates conditions no more restrictive than necessary. *Commonwealth v. Diggs*, 475 Mass. 79, 88–89 (2016).

**E. Extraordinary Relief Is Warranted**

Daily deprivation of medically necessary care constitutes irreparable harm, satisfying the criteria for extraordinary superintendence relief. *Dickerson v. Attorney Gen.*, 396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986).

**F. Preliminary‑Injunction Factors**

1. Likelihood of success: strong on statutory and constitutional grounds.
2. Irreparable harm: ongoing cognitive and vocational impairment.
3. Balance of equities: tailored accommodation fully protects the Commonwealth’s interests.
4. Public interest: upholding civil‑rights compliance in bail determinations.

**G. Presumption of Innocence**

Punitive deprivation of essential medical care prior to conviction violates *Bell v. Wolfish*, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979).

**VII. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **IMMEDIATELY VACATE OR STAY** the blanket prohibition and random‑urinalysis conditions insofar as they disallow or penalize Petitioner’s prescribed micro‑dose amphetamine.
2. **REMAND** to the Woburn District Court with instructions to:
a. Conduct an individualized, evidence‑based inquiry;
b. Apply the “least restrictive means” principle under G. L. c. 276, § 58;
c. Comply fully with the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and constitutional safeguards; and
d. Enter explicit findings before infringing medically necessary treatment.
3. **ALTERNATIVELY, REPORT** these questions to the full Supreme Judicial Court for statewide guidance.
4. **ORDER EXPEDITED OR EMERGENCY RELIEF** to avert continuing irreparable harm.

**VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT**

Forced discontinuation of Petitioner’s medication inflicts daily, compounding harm.  An expedited schedule or interim relief is therefore essential.

**IX. ATTACHMENTS, VERIFICATION, AND CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE**

(Unchanged as previously submitted; see Exhibits 1–4 and Certificate of Service.)

Respectfully submitted this 18th day of July, 2025.
