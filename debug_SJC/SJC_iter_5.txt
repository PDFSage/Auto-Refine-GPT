VI. ARGUMENT

A. The Categorical Drug Ban and Random Urinalysis Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

   1. Title II and Section 504 Apply to Bail and Pre-Trial Release  
      • 42 U.S.C. § 12132 prohibits any public entity from denying qualified individuals with disabilities “the benefits of the services, programs, or activities” it provides. 29 U.S.C. § 794 incorporates the same standards for federally funded programs.  
      • The Supreme Court has held that judicial processes, including bail, are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). The First Circuit and other courts uniformly apply Title II to all phases of criminal proceedings. Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  

   2. The District Court Failed to Provide a Required Reasonable Modification  
      • 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a) mandate an “individualized assessment” of disability‐related medication before excluding it. In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999), the Court emphasized that blanket policies excluding disabled individuals from services without case‐by‐case analysis violate Title II. The First Circuit applied the same principle in Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
      • Here, the District Court imposed a per se ban on “any illegal drugs,” precluding Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without a single medical or threat‐risk finding.  

   3. Blanket Exclusions Are Per Se Unlawful Without Direct-Threat or Fundamental-Alteration Findings  
      • The First Circuit held in Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024), that any categorical exclusion of necessary medication violates Title II unless the entity first makes specific findings, supported by current medical evidence, that the accommodation would pose a “direct threat” or fundamentally alter the program.  
      • Other courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). The Department of Justice’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court expressly prohibits pre-trial blanket medication bans.  

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights

   1. Random Urinalysis Constitutes a Search  
      • Compulsory urine testing is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989), and Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  

   2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable Without Individualized Justification  
      • Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995), and Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997), mandate individualized suspicion or special‐needs justification for suspicionless drug testing. The District Court made neither finding.  
      • Massachusetts courts require at least reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).  

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause

   • “Liberty is the norm,” and pre-trial detention (or de facto detention) must be justified by legitimate interests. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
   • Massachusetts prohibits “excessive” bail, including overly restrictive conditions that infringe constitutional rights. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Forcing Petitioner either to discontinue essential treatment (and risk mental decompensation) or to violate the drug ban (and face revocation and detention) is “excessive.”  

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process

   1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy and Bodily Integrity  
      • Forced withdrawal of prescribed medication offends substantive due process. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
      • Massachusetts recognizes a parallel liberty interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).  

   2. Procedural Requirements for Due Process  
      • At minimum, due process demands written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973).  
      • The District Court issued no such findings. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (G. L. c. 93, § 103)

   • MERA prohibits discrimination “by any person” on the basis of disability. Denying access to the only effective medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
   • MERA is to be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).  

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58

   • Section 58 allows only “the least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure court appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
   • The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to nonappearance or danger and ignored less‐restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. See Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).  

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief Is Warranted Under G. L. c. 211, § 3

   • A Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).  

H. Injunctive-Relief Factors Favor Immediate Relief (Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008))

   1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Overwhelming statutory and constitutional authority.  
   2. Irreparable Harm: Denial of essential medication causes irreversible cognitive, vocational, and psychological injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35.  
   3. Balance of Harms: Public safety is best served by stable treatment; forced discontinuation heightens the risk of impulsivity, relapse, or decompensation.  
   4. Public Interest: Ensuring compliance with federal disability law and equal access to justice is a paramount public interest.

I. Pre-Trial Punishment and Presumption of Innocence

   • Pre-trial detainees cannot be punished before conviction. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6. The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

For all these reasons, Petitioner urges this Court to vacate the blanket drug ban and random‐testing conditions and remand with instructions to provide a reasonable accommodation permitting his prescribed micro-dosed amphetamine under less restrictive monitoring.
