COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions unlawfully (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable modification for his disability—severe dopamine-deficit ADHD controlled only by micro-dosed amphetamine; (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger; and (c) violate:  

  • Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
  • Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and Articles 14, 26, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
  • G. L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement.  

No other adequate remedy exists; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate a bail order that substantially infringes constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).  

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
  • 26 Sep 2024: District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.  

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket ban on all “illegal drugs,” without individualized findings, violate the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due process?  
  2. Does mandatory suspicionless testing violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58?  

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner has severe ADHD diagnosed by Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Oct 2024 neuropsych report). Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his symptoms. At arraignment, Petitioner presented a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed a total drug ban and random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. ADA AND § 504 VIOLATIONS  

1. Title II Covers Pre-Trial Release Conditions  
   – Title II bars public entities from denying qualified individuals the “benefits of services, programs, or activities,” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 parallels Title II, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
   – Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1068–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).

2. Failure to Provide Reasonable Modification  
   – DOJ regulations require an “individualized assessment” before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a). Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
   – The District Court applied a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” foreclosing Petitioner’s only effective treatment without any individualized inquiry.

3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Per Se Unlawful  
   – A public entity must first make evidence-based direct-threat or fundamental-alteration findings before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
   – Courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
   – DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court expressly prohibits pre-trial blanket bans.

4. No Evidence of Direct Threat  
   – The court made no finding that micro-dosed amphetamine increases flight risk or endangers others, relying instead on improper “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS  

1. Random Urinalysis Is a “Search”  
   – Drug testing is a search: Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).

2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
   – Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs showing, suspicionless drug tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
   – Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT AND EXCESSIVE BAIL  

   – Pre-trial liberty is the norm; detention the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
   – Massachusetts prohibits “excessive” bail or conditions that effectively coerce detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). The challenged conditions force either cessation of treatment (and risk of decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention).

D. DUE PROCESS AND BODILY INTEGRITY  

1. Substantive Due Process  
   – There is a protected liberty interest in refusing forced medication withdrawal. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
   – Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a liberty interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
   – Due process requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s treatment needs against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT VIOLATION  

   – MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to lawfully prescribed medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). MERA must be construed liberally. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. ABUSE OF DISCRETION UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58  

   – Bail conditions must be the “least restrictive” means of ensuring appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
   – The court made no findings linking micro-dose amphetamine to risk, and failed to consider less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE AND INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  

   – Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders causing substantial infringement of rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5.  
   – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced cessation of treatment inflicts irreversible injury; (3) balance of harms—stable treatment promotes public safety; (4) public interest—ensuring compliance with disability law and equal justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  

   – Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. These conditions function as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm.  

Petitioner further requests expedited consideration given the immediate and irreparable nature of his injury.
