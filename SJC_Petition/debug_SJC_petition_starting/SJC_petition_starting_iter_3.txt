COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IN RE BO SHANG,  
      Petitioner  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

STATEMENT OF PETITIONER’S ABSOLUTE AND INDEFINITE COMMITMENT TO COMPLY WITH ALL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS  

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby declares in the clearest and most unconditional terms that he is fully committed to obey and honor each and every pretrial release condition imposed by the Woburn District Court in Case No. 5531568, for as long as those conditions remain in effect. Petitioner pledges to continue complying meticulously, indefinitely, and without exception unless and until he secures relief from a higher court of competent jurisdiction. By filing the petition set forth below, Mr. Shang neither disputes nor attempts to circumvent any existing requirements; rather, he seeks a narrow, legally required accommodation—one that would allow him to continue receiving the medically necessary and lawfully prescribed micro-dose amphetamine indispensable for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD. No other provision of this Court’s order is challenged or undermined; Petitioner is firmly resolved to abide by every imposed condition to the fullest extent possible.

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to this Court’s extraordinary superintendence authority under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully seeks an order vacating, in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568 (entered 26 September 2024), two pretrial-release conditions that (1) impose an across-the-board prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and (2) mandate random urinalysis, under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Petitioner reiterates that he stands ready and committed to comply with every condition; however—because his only clinically effective medication for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD, mechanized through micro-dosed amphetamine, is barred by this overbroad restriction—these conditions are unlawfully and unconstitutionally applied. They contravene Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103; and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as cognate provisions in Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Further, because they were imposed without individualized findings linking Petitioner’s clinically prescribed medication to either flight risk or danger to the community, these conditions violate G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that pretrial restrictions be the “least restrictive” measures necessary.

Within the Boston-area federal and state courts, leading precedents uniformly condemn blanket denials of valid prescriptions to pretrial detainees, holding that they violate anti-discrimination law, due process, and the principle against excessive bail conditions. The District Court’s across-the-board bar effectively strips Petitioner of his sole means of managing ADHD, thereby inflicting irreparable harm daily. Appellate routes offer no meaningful relief before trial, which is set for 2 December 2025, and the Middlesex Superior Court has already denied review without findings. Accordingly, extraordinary superintendence relief is warranted to rectify a clear infringement of Petitioner’s statutory and constitutional prerogatives.

II. JURISDICTION

A Single Justice of this Court has the authority to review bail orders, including conditions of release, when those conditions implicate constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). General Laws c. 211, § 3 confers “superintendence of the entire judicial system” in the Supreme Judicial Court. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025). Here, Petitioner has no other adequate remedy because the Superior Court summarily declined relief and trial remains months away. The combination of irreparable harm arising from medication denial and absence of a suitable lower-court remedy qualifies this matter for immediate intervention under G. L. c. 211, § 3.

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

• 26 Sep 2024 – Petitioner was arraigned in Woburn District Court on one count of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A. The court imposed a categorical “no illegal drugs” condition with mandatory random urinalysis.  
• 17 Jul 2025 – Petitioner’s request for relief was summarily denied by the Middlesex Superior Court without findings.  
• Trial is set for 2 Dec 2025. No other recourse exists to cure the ongoing infringement.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” unaccompanied by individualized findings regarding Petitioner’s diagnosis and medically prescribed amphetamine, violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution.  
2. Whether District Court’s imposition of such conditions—absent specific showings of risk—constitutes an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner respectfully incorporates by reference ¶¶ 7–16 from his prior Superior Court filing, including the October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Exhibit 1) confirming severe dopamine-deficit ADHD, the established efficacy of micro-dosed amphetamine as the only viable treatment, and the District Court’s order imposing a blanket “no illegal drugs” condition without tailoring or recognition of Petitioner’s legitimate prescription. Petitioner continues to face diminished cognitive functioning, impaired employment prospects, and severe stress under forced medication cessation.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE ADA AND § 504

1. Title II Forbids Blanket Exclusions of Disabled Individuals

Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, precludes a public entity—here, the Massachusetts Trial Court system—from denying a qualified individual with a disability “the benefits of the services, programs, or activities” of that entity. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527 (2004). Pretrial release is a “program” under the ADA, and random urinalysis or drug bans must account for disability-related medications. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999) (requiring individualized inquiry). Federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a), further mandate “reasonable modifications” unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service or pose a direct threat—a threshold the District Court never even attempted to meet.

Consequently, courts historically reject blanket bans on valid prescriptions. See Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024) (declaring a policy that excludes a defendant’s necessary medication without individualized findings to be facially discriminatory). The District Court’s order here stands in irreconcilable conflict with the frequent holdings of federal and state courts protecting medically necessary treatments for defendants.

2. Parallel Protections Under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 504 prohibits disability-based discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Because Massachusetts courts receive federal funding, they must reasonably accommodate persons with disabilities, including in bail determinations. Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 44–45 (1st Cir. 2019) (affirming injunction requiring that a jail provide opioid maintenance therapy). The District Court’s categorical denial of Petitioner’s micro-dose amphetamine, again lacking individualized justification, is impermissible under § 504.

B. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE FOURTH, FIFTH, EIGHTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS (AND THEIR MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTIONAL ANALOGS)

1. Bodily Integrity Protected by Substantive Due Process

The forced cessation of essential medical treatment intrudes upon Petitioner’s fundamental right to bodily integrity. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990). In the specific milieu of prescribed psychiatric or neurological medication, the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently recognized heightened protections. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992). By mandating cold-turkey suspension of Petitioner’s only effective ADHD medication, the District Court’s order inflicts a serious constitutional violation.

2. The Fourth Amendment and Article 14 – Random Urinalysis as Unreasonable Search

Random urinalysis is a “search” within the meaning of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989). Where such testing is imposed on a blanket and suspicionless basis, a “special needs” justification must exist beyond the normal demands of law enforcement. Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001). No special need or individualized suspicion was ever articulated. Under Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the standard for reasonableness is similarly unmet. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

3. The Eighth Amendment and Article 26 – Excessive Bail or Conditions

Pretrial bail conditions cannot be “excessive” relative to their regulatory objectives. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4–5 (1951). Massachusetts constitutional law echoes this principle in Article 26, prohibiting excessive bail or unnecessarily punitive conditions. Commonwealth v. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 701–02 (2017). By burdening Petitioner far beyond any demonstrated need, these override Petitioner’s presumption of innocence and exact a punitive toll on his health.

4. Procedural Due Process Deficiencies

When a bail condition substantially limits a defendant’s liberty, the judge must provide reasons. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). Massachusetts precedent similarly demands specific, on-the-record findings for conditions that may lead to revocation or undue deprivation. Commonwealth v. Walsh, 485 Mass. 567, 573–74 (2020). The District Court offered no written findings that weigh harm to Petitioner or consider alternative measures. The result is a de facto penalty that lacks the necessary procedural safeguards.

C. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT

MERA, G. L. c. 93, § 103, guarantees that “any person regardless of disability” shall have “the same rights enjoyed by other persons” under state law, including freedom from discrimination in public institutions. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). By categorically barring Petitioner from medically necessary ADHD treatment, the District Court has effectively singled out his disability for disqualification, imposing a burden that similarly situated defendants without ADHD do not face. MERA, which must be “liberally construed,” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997), mandates a remedy.

D. THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58

Bail conditions in Massachusetts must be the “least restrictive” consistent with appearance and safety. G. L. c. 276, § 58; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). Courts must consider less burdensome approaches and articulate findings. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 88–89 (2016). Denying Petitioner’s sole effective medication—rather than imposing, for instance, supervised confirmation of dosage, physician oversight, or daily check-ins—far overshoots the statutory line. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017). This undue rigidity therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion.

E. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS WARRANTED

Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, this Court may remedy a substantial infringement of rights when no alternative remedy is adequate. Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005). Each day Petitioner is deprived of prescribed medication inflicts irreparable harm—cognitively, emotionally, and vocationally. The Superior Court declined intervention, and trial remains months away. The risk of permanent detriment to Petitioner’s ability to function and prepare for his defense justifies immediate superintendence review.

F. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS UNDER WINTER V. NRDC

Petitioner meets all four prongs for emergency injunctive relief. See Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). (1) Likelihood of success: an array of binding precedent invalidates blanket drug bans that ignore lawful prescriptions; (2) Irreparable harm: Petitioner suffers ongoing, serious health consequences; (3) Balance of equities: Petitioner willingly undergoes any lawful oversight necessary but faces disproportionate harm without relief; (4) Public interest: guaranteeing a fair pretrial process compliant with civil-rights laws plainly serves the public.

G. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

“A defendant may not be punished prior to a determination of guilt.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535 (1979). The District Court’s overbroad ban effectively punishes Petitioner by denying essential medication absent any individualized finding about risk or threat. The presumption of innocence is fundamentally compromised by such a heavy-handed restriction.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. VACATE forthwith the “no illegal drugs” and “random urinalysis” conditions as presently applied to prohibit Petitioner’s prescribed micro-dose amphetamine, and REMAND with instructions to craft conditions that accommodate Petitioner’s documented medical and disability needs in conformity with the ADA, § 504, MERA, and G. L. c. 276, § 58.  
2. Alternatively, REPORT the important constitutional and statutory questions here to the full Supreme Judicial Court.  
3. GRANT such other relief as justice and equity require, including expedited resolution given the ongoing nature of Petitioner’s injuries.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

Petitioner urgently requires reinstatement of his essential ADHD medication. Each day’s continued deprivation compounds cognitive, psychiatric, and economic damage that cannot be fully undone, even if he ultimately prevails at trial. Expedited consideration is both warranted and necessary.
