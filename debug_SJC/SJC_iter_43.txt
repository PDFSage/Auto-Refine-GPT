COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two bail conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  
These conditions (a) deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They therefore violate:

• Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a))—judicial processes are “programs” under Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014).  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794—standards “parallel” Title II (Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004)).  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103—denial of access to lawfully prescribed medication is per se discrimination (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004)).  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14—random, suspicionless drug testing is an unreasonable search (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995)).  
• Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 and Excessive Bail Clause—“liberty is the norm” (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017)). Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”  
• Fourteenth Amendment—substantive due process protects bodily integrity (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); procedural due process requires written, specific findings balancing state interests and treatment needs (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979)).  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58—the “least restrictive” condition necessary to ensure appearance and public safety (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).

No other adequate remedy exists; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights where no other adequate remedy exists. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court (No. 5531568) imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without written findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025: Trial set; absent relief, Petitioner endures ongoing, irreparable harm.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel proffered a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nevertheless imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” and random, suspicionless urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings whatsoever.

V. ARGUMENT

A. Title II/§ 504—Denial of Reasonable Modification  
  1. ADA/504 apply to bail and pre-trial release.  
  2. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) require an individualized inquiry before excluding prescribed medication. Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581; Nunes, 766 F.3d 136.  
  3. Blanket bans are per se unlawful absent specific, evidence-based direct-threat or fundamental-alteration findings. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234; Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018). DOJ’s 2022 Massachusetts Trial Court settlement bars such bans.  
  4. Prohibition on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. Fourth Amendment/Art. 14—Unreasonable Search  
  • Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602; Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67.  
  • Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, it violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646; Chandler, 520 U.S. 305; Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246.

C. Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail & Art. 26  
  • Pre-trial restraint must be narrowly tailored. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739; Stack, 342 U.S. 1; Brangan, 477 Mass. 691.  
  • Conditions forcing discontinuation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process  
  1. Substantive—Liberty in medical autonomy. Harper, 494 U.S. 210; Riggins, 504 U.S. 127; Sell, 539 U.S. 166; Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90.  
  2. Procedural—Written, specific findings required. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319; Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778; Bell, 441 U.S. 520. None exist.

E. MERA—Disability Discrimination  
  • MERA prohibits discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844; Bain, 424 Mass. 758.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58—Abuse of Discretion  
  • Conditions must be least restrictive. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79; Lougee, 485 Mass. 70.  
  • Court made no risk findings and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163; Durling, 407 Mass. 108.

G. Superintendence Relief & Injunctive-Relief Standards  
  • Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate infringing orders. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra.  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008): (1) Likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation causes irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) Balance—stable treatment promotes public safety; (4) Public interest—upholding disability rights and equal justice is paramount.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520; Stack, 342 U.S. 1.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
