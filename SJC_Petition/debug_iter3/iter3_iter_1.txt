COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IN RE BO SHANG,  
      Petitioner  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

ABSOLUTE, INDEFINITE, AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO OBEY ALL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS  
(DECLARED AT THE OUTSET FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF ANY DOUBT)

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby makes it unequivocally clear to all courts and all readers that he fully accepts, respects, and will indefinitely fulfill every single pretrial release condition imposed upon him, for as long as said conditions remain valid and binding. Should any portion of those conditions be altered or vacated by a higher court of competent jurisdiction, only then—and only to that extent—will Mr. Shang’s obligations be modified. Until such time, HIS COMPLIANCE IS ABSOLUTE, UNQUALIFIED, AND CONTINUING.

This solemn promise is not merely a gesture; it is Mr. Shang’s codified pledge to meet and exceed every requirement, including but not limited to appearance obligations, reporting, and any and all additional monitoring conditions. Mr. Shang respects the integrity of the judicial process, the authority of the courts, and the fundamental importance of adhering to these imposed conditions.  

He seeks only a narrow and legally required accommodation concerning his medically necessary micro-dose amphetamine (clinically indispensable for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD), so as to ensure no conflict with the categorical “no illegal drugs” clause. Mr. Shang does not—under any theory—seek to circumvent or disobey; rather, he petitions to align unambiguously his strict adherence to pretrial rules with the lawful, physician-prescribed treatment that he absolutely requires for normal cognitive functioning.

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRETRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

I. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully petitions for an order vacating two pretrial-release conditions—imposed on 26 September 2024 in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568—that categorically: (1) prohibit “any illegal drugs,” and (2) mandate random urinalysis, under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Petitioner emphatically confirms that he will continue to fully comply with all conditions; however, because the blanket prohibition extends to the clinically prescribed micro-dose amphetamine essential to address his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD, the conditions are unlawfully and unconstitutionally applied to him. Their effect violates, among other provisions, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103; and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Furthermore, because these blanket conditions were imposed without individualized findings linking Petitioner’s lawful medication to risk of flight or danger, they run counter to G. L. c. 276, § 58, which requires “least restrictive” measures.

Binding precedent within both the federal courts (including First Circuit opinions) and Massachusetts courts consistently condemns categorical bans that deprive pretrial defendants of duly prescribed medication. See, e.g., Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). The District Court’s order strips Petitioner of the only effective means of treating his ADHD, subjecting him to irreparable harm on a daily basis. Because direct appeals will not yield relief before trial, and the Middlesex Superior Court has already summarily refused to intervene, extraordinary superintendence relief is urgently warranted to cure a manifest deprivation of Petitioner’s statutory and constitutional rights.

II. JURISDICTION

A Single Justice of this Court is empowered to review bail orders and their conditions for constitutional and legal deficiencies. See Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, the Supreme Judicial Court enjoys broad superintendence authority. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025). Because the Superior Court declined relief without findings, and Petitioner’s trial remains months away, no other adequate or timely remedy exists. Petitioner’s ongoing, irreparable harm—denial of medically indispensable medication—further establishes grounds for immediate intervention. See Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005).

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

• 26 Sep 2024 – Petitioner arraigned in Woburn District Court for assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A). A blanket “no illegal drugs” condition and random-urinalysis requirement were imposed (Case No. 5531568).  
• 17 Jul 2025 – Petitioner’s motion in Middlesex Superior Court seeking relief was summarily denied with no findings.  
• Trial is scheduled for 2 Dec 2025. No alternative recourse is available to address the continued constitutional violations before trial.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether a wholesale ban on “any illegal drugs,” without accommodating Petitioner’s valid, medically prescribed amphetamine, violates the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (including Massachusetts constitutional analogs).  
2. Whether the District Court’s imposition of these conditions, absent any individualized showing of flight risk or danger specifically connected to Petitioner’s prescribed medication, constitutes an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, thereby warranting extraordinary relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner incorporates by reference ¶¶ 7–16 of his prior Superior Court filings. There, the October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation by Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Exhibit 1) confirms Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD, and documents the efficacy of micro-dosed amphetamine as the sole suitable treatment. The District Court’s untailored “no illegal drugs” order truncated Petitioner’s lawful prescription, causing diminished cognition, heightened stress, compromised employability, and ongoing medical hardship.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THE CHALLENGED CONDITIONS VIOLATE FEDERAL ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS (ADA & § 504)

1. Blanket Exclusions Are Forbidden Under Title II of the ADA

Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, bars public entities from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from the benefits of services, programs, or activities. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999). Bail and pretrial release proceedings constitute a “program or activity” within the scope of the ADA. Any drug-testing provision, “no-illegal-drugs” condition, or other release restriction must incorporate a reasonable modification for a lawfully prescribed medication addressing a recognized disability. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).

Courts repeatedly disapprove categorical bans on medically necessary prescriptions for pretrial detainees. See Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024) (holding that a policy excluding an inmate’s necessary medications absent individualized analysis is discriminatory on its face). The District Court’s order effectively labels Petitioner’s micro-dose amphetamine as per se prohibited, affording no individualized inquiry or ADA-appropriate accommodation. Such a blanket policy is incompatible with controlling federal law.

2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act Independently Prohibits the Same Discriminatory Result

Because Massachusetts trial courts receive federal financial assistance, they must comply with § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Section 504’s anti-discrimination requirements mirror those of the ADA. See Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 44–45 (1st Cir. 2019). The District Court’s unconditional prohibition on even legally prescribed amphetamines, without “reasonable accommodation” to Petitioner’s documented disability, constitutes a violation of § 504 as well. Its approach is neither individualized nor tethered to any legitimate safety or flight concern.

B. THE CONDITIONS OFFEND MULTIPLE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS

1. Substantive Due Process and Bodily Integrity

It is a bedrock principle that the Constitution safeguards bodily autonomy, especially regarding the administration of necessary medical treatment. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990). Denying Petitioner’s ADHD medication contravenes these protections, analogous to forcing unwanted medication changes. Cf. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 134, 136 (1992) (holding that forced medication changes raise strong constitutional concerns). By rendering Petitioner unable to access a lawfully prescribed micro-dose amphetamine, the District Court’s conditions intrude deeply upon bodily integrity and medical necessity.

2. Unreasonable Searches Under the Fourth Amendment and Article 14

Random urinalysis is undeniably a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989). Imposing suspicionless and sweeping drug tests on a pretrial defendant—particularly one whose only “drug” is a physician-approved medication—cannot be deemed reasonable unless justified by “special needs” beyond normal law enforcement. Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 78 (2001). The District Court never provided any individualized rationale or special-needs showing. Under Massachusetts law (Article 14 of the Declaration of Rights), random, suspicionless searches also fail. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

3. Excessive Bail and Punitive Conditions Under the Eighth Amendment and Article 26

Bail conditions that exceed what is necessary to secure appearance and protect public safety are deemed “excessive.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4–5 (1951); Commonwealth v. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 701–02 (2017). The District Court’s blanket prohibition imposes disproportionate harm on Petitioner’s health, effectively punishing him pretrial and thus infringing his presumption of innocence. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979). Under Article 26, the results are similarly condemned as unnecessarily punitive and injurious.

4. Procedural Due Process Deficiencies

When imposing or maintaining significant bail restrictions, procedural due process mandates that the court articulate clear reasons on the record. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535–37. Massachusetts precedent echoes the need for specific findings where conditions encroach on fundamental liberty interests. Commonwealth v. Walsh, 485 Mass. 567, 573–74 (2020). Here, there is no recorded analysis that ties Petitioner’s lawfully prescribed medication to flight or danger. Absent such findings, the condition is patently defective.

C. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT

MERA, G. L. c. 93, § 103, ensures that every person, regardless of disability, enjoys the same protection under state law. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). Petitioner is singled out for disadvantage on account of his ADHD, prevented from using the only medically recognized prescription that alleviates his condition. This contravention of MERA is especially stark given the Act’s mandate for liberal construction to eradicate disability-based disparity. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

D. THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION UNDER G. L. C. 276, § 58

Under G. L. c. 276, § 58, pretrial conditions must be the “least restrictive” tool consistent with appearance and public safety. Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). A sweeping prohibition precluding Petitioner from the one medication that enables him to function is indisputably overbroad. Alternative, viable conditions—e.g., verifying the prescription’s legitimacy, requiring medical documentation, or limited supervised administration—were never considered. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 88–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017). Such disregard for narrowly tailored measures is a textbook abuse of discretion.

E. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY

This Court’s superintendence authority under G. L. c. 211, § 3 exists to remedy substantial rights violations when lower courts deny meaningful redress. See Votta, 444 Mass. at 1001. Petitioner’s daily deprivation of medically necessary amphetamine yields irreparable physical, emotional, and professional harm. Trial remains months away, and the Superior Court’s summary refusal left no adequate remedy. In these circumstances, immediate correction by the Supreme Judicial Court is not only permissible but essential to prevent continuing constitutional and statutory violations.

F. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS (WINTER V. NRDC)

(1) Likelihood of Success. The wealth of controlling precedent disapproves of blanket denials of necessary medication to disabled individuals. Petitioner’s legal arguments thus have a strong likelihood of success.  
(2) Irreparable Harm. Ongoing denial of prescribed ADHD medication results in serious cognitive and emotional harm, compromising Petitioner’s capacity to work, concentrate, and prepare a defense.  
(3) Balance of Equities. The government’s interest in safety or preventing flight may be served by far less burdensome methods. Meanwhile, Petitioner faces grievous harm daily.  
(4) Public Interest. Ensuring a fair, non-discriminatory bail system clearly serves the public interest, upholding constitutional and statutory protections and maximizing Petitioner’s rehabilitative prospects.

G. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE MANDATES NON-PUNITIVE CONDITIONS

It is firmly established that a defendant must not be punished prior to adjudication. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535. The District Court’s unindividualized ban punishes Petitioner medically and psychologically, breaching his presumption of innocence. No finding suggests that Petitioner’s prescription poses any threat, yet he endures a forced cessation with severe repercussions.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that the Court:

1. IMMEDIATELY VACATE the challenged “no illegal drugs” and “random urinalysis” conditions as presently applied to bar Petitioner’s prescribed micro-dose amphetamine, and REMAND to the District Court with directions to adopt narrowly tailored, ADA-compliant conditions, mindful of Petitioner’s disability-related medical needs under G. L. c. 276, § 58.  
2. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, REPORT these significant constitutional and statutory questions to the full Supreme Judicial Court for definitive resolution.  
3. GRANT any other just and equitable relief, including expedited review, so Petitioner’s ongoing hardship is alleviated without delay.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

Each day of lost medication inflicts irreversible harm. Petitioner’s neurological condition, employability, and general well-being degrade in real time. Because the milestones of trial lie months away, expedited attention is indispensable to prevent further harm and uphold Petitioner’s rights.
