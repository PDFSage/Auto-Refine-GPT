COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IN RE BO SHANG,  
        Petitioner.  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STATEMENT OF PETITIONER’S FULL AND INDEFINITE COMPLIANCE WITH PRETRIAL CONDITIONS

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby declares, in unequivocal terms, his unwavering commitment to abide by and fully comply with all pretrial release conditions currently ordered by the Woburn District Court (Case No. 5531568). He binds himself to observe and follow each condition meticulously and indefinitely, unless and until a higher court of competent authority issues an order vacating or modifying such conditions. By filing this Petition, Mr. Shang does not in any way seek to circumvent, disregard, or weaken the District Court’s directives; rather, he seeks a narrowly tailored and legally mandated accommodation that would allow him to continue receiving his medically necessary and lawfully prescribed micro-dose amphetamine, which experts have determined essential to manage his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD. Mr. Shang’s resolve to comply with all other conditions—including, but not limited to, maintaining scheduled court appearances, complying with any stay-away provisions, and adhering to all supervision requirements—remains absolute and unquestionable.

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully requests an order vacating, in Woburn District Court No. 5531568 (entered 26 September 2024), (1) a categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and (2) mandatory random urinalysis as conditions of pre-trial release under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Petitioner, who unreservedly affirms his readiness to follow all pretrial requirements, has repeatedly demonstrated full adherence to every condition and will continue to do so indefinitely. However, the blanket prohibition against “any illegal drugs” effectively bars Petitioner from continuing his medically supervised micro-dose amphetamine—a lawfully prescribed, federally approved treatment for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD condition. This prohibition stands unaccompanied by any individualized findings relating Petitioner’s necessary medication to a risk of flight or danger to public safety.

The challenged condition is unconstitutional and contravenes binding legal authorities that forbid categorical policies denying pretrial defendants reasonable disability accommodations. The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.), § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794), the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (G. L. c. 93, § 103), and constitutional principles under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as cognate provisions in Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, all require that a court fashion conditions that are no more restrictive than necessary. Because Petitioner’s essential medication is outright banned without an individualized analysis, the District Court has exceeded its discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58 by imposing conditions that are both overbroad and insufficiently justified.

The unavailability of a meaningful remedy in the lower courts requires immediate superintendence by this Court: Petitioner suffers daily, irreparable harm—all while fulfilling, and pledging to fulfill indefinitely, every other aspect of his release conditions.

II. JURISDICTION

A Single Justice of this Court has jurisdiction to review bail orders or related conditions where, as here, they implicate constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). General Laws c. 211, § 3 grants “superintendence of the entire judicial system” to this Court. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025). Because the Middlesex Superior Court denied relief with no findings and because his trial is not scheduled until 2 December 2025, Petitioner has no other adequate remedy. The extraordinary nature of the health and constitutional violations further supports this Court’s immediate intervention.

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

• 26 Sep 2024 – Petitioner was arraigned in the Woburn District Court on one count of assault and battery under G. L. c. 265, § 13A. The District Court imposed the contested blanket “no drugs” restriction and mandated random urinalysis.  
• 17 Jul 2025 – The Middlesex Superior Court summarily denied Petitioner’s request for relief without issuing findings or an evidentiary hearing.  
• Trial is scheduled for 2 Dec 2025. There is no practical means of obtaining relief short of this Petition for superintendence.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs”—with no individualized findings nor evidence that Petitioner’s clinically supervised ADHD medication contributes to flight risk or public danger—violates the ADA, § 504, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, and constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.  
2. Whether, under G. L. c. 276, § 58, the District Court’s failure to consider less restrictive and properly individualized alternatives constitutes an abuse of discretion warranting superintendence relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner incorporates by reference ¶¶ 7–16 of his Superior Court filing, detailing:  
• His clinically diagnosed severe dopamine-deficit ADHD and the unique necessity of micro-dosed amphetamine to restore normal cognitive functioning.  
• The documented medical history from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Exhibit 1, dated October 2024) confirming that pharmacotherapy via amphetamine is Petitioner’s sole effective modality for ADHD symptom control.  
• The District Court’s blanket “no drugs” order, which makes no reference to individualized factors nor addresses Petitioner’s legitimate prescription or the possibility of verifying lawful usage.  
• The ongoing harm to Petitioner’s mental health, ability to concentrate, and consistent employment while he remains barred from his only medically effective therapy.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE ADA AND § 504

1. Title II’s Reasonable Accommodation Requirement

Under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations (28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) and § 35.139(a)), a public entity (including courts) must provide “reasonable modifications” to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Courts must undertake individualized inquiries before depriving qualified individuals of an accommodation. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999). Federal courts have held again and again that categorical bans on medically prescribed medication violate Title II, particularly in a criminal-justice context that triggers heightened scrutiny. See Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *11–12 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024) (blanket exclusion is unlawful where no individualized direct-threat analysis was performed).

Here, the Woburn District Court, by prohibiting Petitioner from using his doctor-recommended and narrowly dosed medication, has provided no reasoned findings that this prescription poses a flight risk or endangers public safety. This omission directly conflicts with Massachusetts law requiring tailored, evidence-based bail conditions. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–88 (2016). A less restrictive condition—namely, verified compliance under physician oversight—would protect public safety without sporadically or categorically disqualifying Petitioner from his medication.

2. Parallel Requirements Under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) imposes essentially the same non-discrimination requirements as the ADA. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004). Courts have repeatedly found that government entities—including jails and courts—must accommodate necessary prescription medication. See Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 44-47 (1st Cir. 2019) (preliminary injunction warranted for provision of buprenorphine). By extension, the District Court’s order violates § 504 in withholding from Petitioner the “aid, benefit, or service” of meaningful pretrial release, free from forced medication cessation.

B. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE FOURTH, FIFTH, EIGHTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS, AND COGNATE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS

1. Substantive Due Process and Bodily Integrity

A defendant retains a constitutionally protected liberty interest in bodily integrity and in refusing or maintaining certain medical treatments. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990). Forcing Petitioner into medication withdrawal, absent a showing of overriding state interest, infringes upon that liberty. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992). Massachusetts courts uphold this principle under Articles 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996).

2. The Fourth Amendment and Article 14 – Random Urinalysis as an Unreasonable Search

Random urinalysis is a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989). In a bail setting, courts must demonstrate a “special need” or particularized suspicion. Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001). The District Court’s order is unaccompanied by any showing that Petitioner’s prescribed medication usage is linked to any criminal indicia or risk factor. Where no “nexus to probationary or bail-based objectives” or “reasonable suspicion” is articulated, the interference is unreasonable. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

3. The Eighth Amendment and Article 26 – Prohibition of Excessive Bail or Conditions

Bail conditions cannot impose restraints beyond what is necessary to ensure appearance and public safety. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4–5 (1951). Similarly, Article 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights forbids excessive conditions that effectively punish without a finding of guilt. Commonwealth v. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 701–02 (2017). By failing to tailor the “no drugs” ban—indeed by ignoring whether Petitioner’s medication is lawfully prescribed—the District Court has imposed conditions more burdensome than necessary.

4. Procedural Due Process – The Need for Particularized Findings

A trial court must articulate findings that justify any significant intrusion on a pretrial defendant’s liberty. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). Massachusetts law likewise directs courts to explain their reasons for imposing conditions likely to infringe upon substantial rights. Commonwealth v. Walsh, 485 Mass. 567, 573–74 (2020). The District Court never explained why Petitioner’s medication was forbidden or whether safer alternatives were considered. Such an omission deprives Petitioner of basic procedural due process.

C. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT

The Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103, prohibits disability-based discrimination in the enjoyment of rights “protected by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth.” Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). Withholding Petitioner’s single effective ADHD medication while releasing other defendants under less onerous conditions subjects Petitioner to disparate treatment—i.e., denial of “equal benefit” to pretrial release. MERA is interpreted broadly. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). The District Court’s unqualified ban effectuates a classic form of discrimination by ignoring Petitioner’s disability and failing to adopt feasible accommodations.

D. THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58

Bail conditions must be “no more onerous than necessary,” consistent with ensuring court appearance and public safety. G. L. c. 276, § 58; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). Failing to explore “less restrictive alternatives”—such as verifying Petitioner’s prescription, supervised administration, or daily check-ins—constitutes an abuse of judicial discretion. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 95 (2018). The District Court, in ignoring these permissible options and opting instead for a broad categorical prohibition, departed from the statutory standard requiring specificity and tailoring.

E. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS WARRANTED

Relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3 is appropriate where a lower-court ruling inflicts a “substantial infringement of a substantive right” and no adequate alternative remedy exists. Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005). Petitioner is actively suffering neurological instability and cognitive harm each day he is barred from his necessary medication. With trial set months away and the Superior Court having summarily denied meaningful review, direct recourse to this Court is indispensable.

F. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS UNDER WINTER V. NRDC

Petitioner meets all four Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), criteria for emergency injunctive relief:  
1) He is likely to succeed on the merits, given uniform federal and state case law rejecting blanket bans on prescribed medication for disabled defendants.  
2) He will suffer irreparable harm, as each day of forced medication cessation inflicts significant harm on his mental and emotional well-being.  
3) The balance of equities favors relief, as Petitioner does not oppose appropriate, legitimate supervision of his prescription usage—only the outright ban.  
4) The public interest is served by safeguarding constitutional rights, improving compliance with anti-discrimination laws, and preserving the presumption of innocence.

G. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

Because Petitioner awaits trial, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535–37. Imposing manifestly punitive conditions absent findings to rebut that presumption violates core principles of constitutional and state law. Petitioner is demonstrably willing to maintain strict compliance with all lawful conditions but seeks only the minimal accommodation that avoids irreparable harm to his health.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. VACATE the “no drugs” and “random urinalysis” pretrial release conditions insofar as they prohibit Petitioner from continuing his medically prescribed micro-dose amphetamine and require suspicionless or unsubstantiated searches, and REMAND with instructions to adopt reasonable, individualized accommodations consistent with G. L. c. 276, § 58, Title II of the ADA, and § 504;  
2. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions presented to the full Supreme Judicial Court for review; and  
3. GRANT such other and further relief as equity and justice may require, including expedited consideration given the ongoing and irreparable harm to Petitioner.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

Petitioner suffers immediate cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm each day that he is deprived of the only effective ADHD treatment he has known. Delay in addressing this harm risks permanent injuries that no post-trial relief can meaningfully rectify. Accordingly, Petitioner requests expedited review and issuance of an appropriate order as swiftly as practicable.
