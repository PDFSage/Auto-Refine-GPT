COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two September 26, 2024 conditions imposed by Woburn District Court (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  

• Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103;  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights;  
• Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause and Art. 26 of the Mass. Decl. of Rights;  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard.  

Immediate superintendence relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025). No adequate alternative remedy exists.

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; absent relief, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm.

IV. FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel submitted the prescription and expert report. Nevertheless, the court imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA AND SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars any public entity from excluding qualified individuals from “programs” it offers. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004). Bail and pre-trial supervision are “programs.” Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1068–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).

2. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Modification: DOJ regulations require an “individualized assessment” before excluding medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban on all illegal drugs forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment without inquiry.

3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful: Exclusion of necessary medication requires evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024); 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); DOJ–Mass. Trial Ct. 2022 Settlement (§§ 2–9).

4. Prohibition on Stereotypes: Congress found that “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). Here, no findings link micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT AND ART. 14  
1. Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Suspicionless testing is unreasonable absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL AND ART. 26  
Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment (risking decompensation) or noncompliance (risking detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996).  
2. Procedural: Requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against medical necessity. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” Denial of access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 (“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”)  
Conditions must be narrowly tailored. Diggs, 475 Mass. at 87–89; Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE AND INJUNCTION STANDARDS  
A Single Justice may vacate an order substantially infringing rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, slip op. at 4–5. Under Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), Petitioner satisfies:  
  • Likelihood of success—overwhelming statutory and constitutional violations;  
  • Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35);  
  • Balance of harms—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
  • Public interest—ensuring compliance with disability laws and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
