COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IN RE BO SHANG,  
      Petitioner  
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

         ABSOLUTE, INDEFINITE, AND IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO COMPLY  
          WITH ALL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS – DECLARATION AT THE OUTSET  

TO THE HONORABLE COURT AND ALL READERS:

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby makes, in the most unmistakable and emphatic terms, his absolute, perpetual, and unwavering commitment to obey every single pretrial condition imposed by the Woburn District Court in Case No. 5531568—without modification, evasion, or exception—for as long as those conditions remain in force. Petitioner does not challenge, repudiate, or attempt to circumvent any term of his release. He solemnly pledges continued, indefinite adherence to every condition, as ordered, until and unless a higher court of competent jurisdiction modifies or vacates any part thereof.

This declaration is neither rhetorical nor conditional. It is a binding and unqualified commitment made on the record and in writing. By seeking only a narrow, lawful accommodation pertaining to his prescribed micro-dose amphetamine (the sole effective treatment for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD), Petitioner aims to reconcile his strict compliance with valid medical necessity. No other condition is questioned or resisted. In fact, Petitioner stands ready to surpass every monitoring and reporting requirement, attend all court dates, and otherwise fulfill his obligations to the fullest. He respectfully urges this Court to grant the narrowly tailored relief detailed below, while he simultaneously maintains his ironclad promise to abide by all remaining pretrial conditions.

    PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
      EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. INTRODUCTION

By invoking the Supreme Judicial Court’s extraordinary power of general superintendence under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully petitions for an order vacating—or suitably tailoring—two pretrial-release conditions imposed on 26 September 2024, in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568, that (1) impose a blanket “no illegal drugs” prohibition, and (2) require random urinalysis under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Petitioner does not question the Court’s authority to impose bail conditions generally. Rather, these particular conditions—applied without individualized findings—effectively bar Petitioner from continuing the only clinically effective medication for his diagnosed dopamine-deficit ADHD. As such, they conflict with:

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
• The Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103.  
• Multiple constitutional provisions, including the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
• The statutory requirement under G. L. c. 276, § 58 that pretrial measures be the “least restrictive” means necessary to secure appearance and ensure community safety.

Well-established precedent—local, state, and federal—has uniformly invalidated blanket pretrial or detention policies that deny lawful, physician-prescribed medications to individuals with disabilities. See, e.g., Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *18–19 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Because Petitioner’s urgent medical need cannot wait until a post-trial appeal, and the Middlesex Superior Court summarily denied relief, superintendence intervention is both necessary and appropriate. See Dickerson v. Attorney Gen., 396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986) (granting G. L. c. 211, § 3 relief when no other avenue can afford timely remedy).

II. JURISDICTION

This Court, through a single justice or the full bench, has robust authority to supervise and correct lower courts’ bail determinations. See Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002); G. L. c. 211, § 3. Where a defendant suffers ongoing constitutional infringement with no meaningful recourse below—especially in circumstances risking irreparable harm—extraordinary relief is warranted. Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005). Petitioner’s inability to take the sole medication sustaining his cognitive and psychiatric health constitutes irreparable harm that the Superior Court has refused to address, thus placing this case squarely within the Court’s superintendence power.

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On 26 September 2024, Petitioner was arraigned in Woburn District Court (Case No. 5531568) on one count of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A. The District Court imposed broad pretrial conditions, including a “no illegal drugs” clause and mandatory random urinalysis. None of these conditions was tailored to Petitioner’s disability or made subject to an exception for lawful prescriptions.  
2. On 17 July 2025, Petitioner sought leave in the Middlesex Superior Court to continue his ADHD medication—proving psychiatric necessity—and requested limited modification or clarification of the pretrial order. That application was denied outright with no explanation.  
3. Petitioner’s trial is set for 2 December 2025, leaving him several months under an order that deprives him of his prescribed micro-dose amphetamine therapy. No further remedy exists in the lower court system to cure this ongoing violation.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether the District Court’s wholesale prohibition on “illegal drugs” and imposition of random urinalysis—without an individualized exemption for medically necessary ADHD medication—violates the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as the cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
2. Whether imposing these conditions in the absence of any specific finding that Petitioner’s prescribed medication creates a risk of flight or public danger constitutes an abuse of discretion, thereby compelling relief under G. L. c. 276, § 58 and G. L. c. 211, § 3.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner incorporates by reference the factual record from his Superior Court filings (dated 17 July 2025). In particular:

• A neuropsychological evaluation dated October 2024 from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH confirms Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD.  
• Micro-dose amphetamine therapy is the sole effective treatment for Petitioner’s symptoms, with documented improvement in focus, executive function, and emotional regulation.  
• The District Court imposed conditions that entirely ban “all illegal drugs” and demand random urinalysis, conflating Petitioner’s lawful medication with illegal substance use.  
• Deprivation of medication has caused Petitioner loss of employment opportunities, significant cognitive impairment, and undue emotional distress.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THESE CONDITIONS VIOLATE FEDERAL DISABILITY RIGHTS LAWS (ADA AND § 504)

1. TITLE II OF THE ADA FORBIDS BLANKET POLICIES DEPRIVING PRETRIAL DEFENDANTS OF NECESSARY MEDICATION

Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, mandates that public entities, including state courts, make reasonable modifications to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004). Bail and pretrial release clearly qualify as “services, programs, or activities” under the ADA. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602–03 (1999). Blanket rules that fail to distinguish between illicit street drugs and medically prescribed treatments for a recognized disability constitute impermissible discrimination. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).

Relevant case law is unequivocal: a blanket “anti-drug” policy enforced against a defendant whose “drug” is a legitimate, critically needed prescription is facially discriminatory. See Theriault, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *19 (striking down jail’s blanket ban on ADHD medication without individualized review). No evidence suggests Petitioner’s medication endangers the public or impedes court processes. Consequently, the District Court’s approach violates the ADA.

2. SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT PROHIBITS THE SAME EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICE

Because Massachusetts trial courts receive federal funding, they must comply with § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The standards under § 504 and the ADA “are functionally identical.” Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 2019). Denying Petitioner’s necessary medication constitutes “denial of benefit” solely due to his disability, contravening § 504. Courts can, and indeed must, adopt straightforward accommodations (e.g., verifying prescription authenticity and dosage) to avoid punishing an individual with a disability for lawfully addressing a recognized medical condition.

B. THE CONDITIONS CONTRAVENE PETITIONER’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

1. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS AND BODILY INTEGRITY ARE IMPERILED

The Supreme Court has reliably held that individuals retain a protected liberty interest in medical treatment decisions. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1990). While Harper and Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992), often deal with forced medication, the same logic applies when government action forcibly prohibits medication needed for a legitimate medical reason. The District Court’s unconditional ban compels Petitioner’s involuntary cessation of critical ADHD treatment, depriving him of bodily autonomy and interfering with a medically recognized need.

2. A BLANKET, SUSPICIONLESS “SEARCH” VIA RANDOM URINALYSIS VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT AND ARTICLE 14

Random urinalysis is a “search” under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989). Such searches, absent individualized suspicion or a valid “special need,” generally run afoul of Fourth Amendment standards. See Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 78 (2001). Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights offers parallel (and sometimes heightened) protections. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016). The pretrial context does not automatically justify suspicionless searches, especially where the “drug” at issue is a physician-monitored prescription.

3. THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT AND ARTICLE 26 PROSCRIBE EXCESSIVE OR PUNITIVE BAIL CONDITIONS

Pretrial conditions should not punish but solely ensure presence and protect the community. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746–47 (1987). A condition that gratuitously undermines a documented medical necessity is inherently punitive and contrary to the presumption of innocence. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). Under Massachusetts law, bail must also avoid “excessive” or unduly harsh conditions. Commonwealth v. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 700 (2017) (excessive bail runs contrary to Article 26). By forcing Petitioner off essential medication, the court’s restriction punishes rather than protects.

4. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS REQUIRES SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Restrictions with grave repercussions—particularly those threatening health—must be accompanied by detailed judicial findings. Id.; Commonwealth v. Walsh, 485 Mass. 567, 573 (2020). Here, the District Court never articulated any risk-based rationale for barring a legitimate prescription. No record exists linking micro-dose amphetamine to flight or danger. This glaring omission, in effect, strips Petitioner of the opportunity to contest an unconstitutional intrusion.

C. THE MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT (MERA) IS VIOLATED

MERA, G. L. c. 93, § 103, guarantees that individuals with disabilities enjoy “the same rights enjoyed by other persons” in Massachusetts. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851 (2004). By denying Petitioner the ability to maintain necessary medication solely because of his ADHD—a disability recognized by both state and federal authorities—the District Court has subjected him to a form of unequal treatment. MERA demands liberal construction to eradicate precisely this type of discrimination. Bain v. City of Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766 (1997).

D. THE CONDITIONS BREACH THE “LEAST RESTRICTIVE” MANDATE UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58

Massachusetts law compels courts to impose only the “least restrictive” combination of conditions needed to ensure court appearance and public safety. G. L. c. 276, § 58; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 74 (2020). There is no discernible justification for a total ban on Petitioner’s medically necessary amphetamine, especially where precise, less onerous means (physician oversight, proof of prescription, partial waivers) could achieve the State’s interests. Imposing a condition that so severely burdens Petitioner’s health and livelihood—without customizing or balancing alternatives—constitutes an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87 (2016).

E. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS NECESSARY AND PROPER

Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, “[t]he Supreme Judicial Court shall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses.” Because the Superior Court summarily declined to intervene and trial is still months away, Petitioner lacks any adequate alternative remedy. Each day Petitioner endures forced medication withdrawal inflicts irreparable harm and undermines his preparation for trial. This scenario fits precisely the rationale for employing superintendence power to prevent continuing violations of constitutional and statutory rights. See Votta, 444 Mass. at 1001; Dickerson, 396 Mass. at 743.

F. PRELIMINARY RELIEF FACTORS—FURTHER JUSTIFYING AN EMERGENCY ORDER

1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Petitioner’s numerous statutory and constitutional arguments mirror controlling authority rejecting blanket bans on legitimate prescriptions.  
2. Irreparable Harm: For every day Petitioner remains off essential medication, he suffers tangible cognitive and economic harm that cannot be fully repaired post-trial.  
3. Balance of Equities: The State’s interest in preventing illicit drug use or ensuring court appearance can be safeguarded through less restrictive monitoring. Petitioner’s medical need is urgent and paramount.  
4. Public Interest: Protecting constitutional rights and ensuring nondiscriminatory bail conditions foster public confidence in the judicial system.

G. THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE PROHIBITS PRETRIAL PUNISHMENT

A defendant must not be penalized prior to a determination of guilt. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535. Yet a total prohibition on medically necessary ADHD medication—absent any plausible showing of risk—operates as a punitive measure. Such an approach, by its nature, violates the bedrock principle of presumed innocence.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, in light of the ongoing and grave harm to Petitioner’s constitutional and statutory rights, Petitioner respectfully asks that this Honorable Court:

1. IMMEDIATELY VACATE the blanket “no illegal drugs” and random urinalysis conditions—solely as they prohibit or penalize Petitioner’s legally prescribed micro-dose amphetamine—in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568.  
2. REMAND with instructions that the District Court (a) conduct individualized findings regarding any perceived risk, (b) adopt narrowly tailored conditions consistent with G. L. c. 276, § 58, (c) accommodate Petitioner’s prescription under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, and (d) comply with procedural due process mandates.  
3. ALTERNATIVELY, REPORT these significant issues of first impression or recurring importance to the full Supreme Judicial Court for final resolution.  
4. GRANT such other and further emergency relief (including a stay of the challenged restrictions pending final adjudication) as justice, equity, and Petitioner’s urgent medical needs require.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION

Petitioner is experiencing material harm every day he is forced to forgo his clinically essential ADHD medication. Given that trial remains months away, further delay would deepen his suffering and may irreparably damage his employment prospects, cognitive functioning, and overall well-being. Accordingly, Petitioner implores the Court to grant expedited consideration of this petition.
