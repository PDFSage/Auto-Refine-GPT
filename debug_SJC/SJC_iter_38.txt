Petitioner Bo Shang respectfully invokes G.L. c. 211, § 3 and SJC Rule 2:22 to vacate two pre‐trial release conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate multiple federal and state laws and constitutional provisions:

I. TITLE II OF THE ADA & SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
 • Coverage: Bail and pre-trial supervision are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dept. of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
 • Reasonable Modification: 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dept. of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014). Here, the court applied a per se ban on amphetamine—Petitioner’s only effective treatment—without inquiry.  
 • Blanket Bans Unlawful: Excluding prescribed medication demands specific, evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, ___ F. App’x ___, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court prohibits blanket pre-trial medication bans.  
 • Myths and Stereotypes Forbidden: Congress found reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

II. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
 • Random urinalysis is a “search.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
 • Suspicionless testing violates the Fourth Amendment absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL CLAUSE & ART. 26  
 • “Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017).  
 • Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment (risking mental decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

IV. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
 1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
 2. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the individual’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were made.

V. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
 • MERA forbids disability discrimination “by any person.” G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

VI. G.L. c. 276, § 58—LEAST RESTRICTIVE STANDARD  
 • Bail conditions must be the least restrictive means of ensuring appearance and public safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
 • The District Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

VII. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
 • Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra.  
 • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible harm (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992)); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access to justice.

VIII. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
 • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

IX. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
