Petitioner Bo Shang respectfully seeks superintendence relief under G.L. c. 211, § 3 and SJC Rule 2:22 to VACATE two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):

  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.

These conditions deny Petitioner the only effective treatment for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, and thus infringe multiple rights.

I. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
  • 42 U.S.C. § 12132 prohibits public entities from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 parallels. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004). Bail and pre-trial release are “programs.” Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).  
  • DOJ regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). Here, the court imposed a per se ban on Petitioner’s prescribed amphetamine—his only effective therapy—without any inquiry.  
  • Blanket exclusions violate Title II absent evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined analogous bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket medication bans.  
  • Congress forbade reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

II. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
  • Random, suspicionless urinalysis is a “search.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
  • Absent individualized suspicion or a “special needs” showing, suspicionless drug testing is unreasonable. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT, EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
  • “Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
  • Massachusetts forbids “excessive bail” and conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions that force discontinuation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

IV. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
  1. Substantive Liberty—Bodily Integrity. Pre-trial detainees possess a liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. U.S., 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
  2. Procedural Due Process. At minimum, due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the detainee’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). No findings were made.

V. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
  • MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denial of access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

VI. G.L. c. 276, § 58—“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”  
  • Conditions must be the least restrictive means to ensure court appearance and public safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
  • The District Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to any risk, nor did it consider less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson v. Commonwealth, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

VII. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
  • Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate an order that infringes substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, supra.  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008) requires:  
    1. A likelihood of success on the merits—overwhelming here;  
    2. Irreparable harm—forced discontinuation of Petitioner’s only effective medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992);  
    3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety, while forced cessation heightens risk of relapse or impulsivity;  
    4. Public interest—ensuring compliance with federal disability law and equal access to justice.

VIII. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
  • “Punishment of the accused prior to conviction” is forbidden. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punitive measures.

IX. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
