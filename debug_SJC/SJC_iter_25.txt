COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), challenges two pre-trial release conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Docket No. 5531568):

1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs”; and  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.

These conditions (a) categorically deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G.L. c. 93, § 103;  
• Fourth Amendment (and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights);  
• Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause (and Art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights);  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail-condition standard.

No adequate remedy exists below; immediate superintendence relief is required to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002).[15] When no other adequate remedy exists, this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power applies. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).[25]

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; absent relief, Petitioner faces irreparable harm.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel proffered a valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or threat-risk findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA AND SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars any “public entity” from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Judicial processes—including bail—are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).[2]  
2. Reasonable Modification: DOJ regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).[3][5] Here, the District Court foreclosed Petitioner’s only effective treatment—micro-dosed amphetamine—without inquiry.  
3. Blanket-Ban Prohibition: Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, ___ F. App’x ___, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).[35] Federal courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).[40][41][42] DOJ’s 2022 Settlement Agreement with the Massachusetts Trial Court likewise bars pre-trial blanket medication prohibitions.[9]  
4. Stereotypes Forbidden: Congress found “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).[33] No findings here link micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT AND ARTICLE 14  
1. Search: Compulsory drug testing is a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).[43][44]  
2. Unreasonable Without Suspicion: Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification, suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).[16][17][45]

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT, ARTICLE 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017).[12][27][14] Conditions forcing cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).[30][31][32][17]  
2. Procedural: Due process requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).[33][16][13] The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denial of access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).[29][37]

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 (“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”)  
Bail conditions must be the least restrictive necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).[26][28] The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).[38]

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions operate as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
