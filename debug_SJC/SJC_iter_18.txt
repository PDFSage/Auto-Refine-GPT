COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE‐TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3 to vacate two pre‐trial release conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions  
  a. Deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine‐deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro‐dosed amphetamine—and  
  b. Were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger.  

They violate:  
  • Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
  • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  • Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
  • Fourth Amendment;  
  • Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause;  
  • Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; and  
  • G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary.  

Immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G. L. c. 211, § 3 applies. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC‐13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court (Docket No. 5531568) imposes the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; no timely alternative relief is available.

IV. FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro‐dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel submitted Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert evidence, but the District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket drug ban and random urinalysis without any medical or threat‐risk findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due process?  
  2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act Prohibit Blanket Medication Bans  
1. Title II/§ 504 Cover Bail and Pre‐Trial Release  
   – 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Courts treat bail and pre‐trial supervision as “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998).  

2. Denial of a Required Individualized Assessment  
   – DOJ regulations require case‐by‐case analysis before excluding prescribed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). Here, the District Court applied a per se ban on “any illegal drugs,” foreclosing Petitioner’s only effective treatment without inquiry.

3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful  
   – Excluding prescription medication requires evidence‐based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or “fundamentally alter[s]” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
   – Federal courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
   – DOJ’s 2022 Settlement Agreement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre‐trial blanket medication prohibitions.

4. Reliance on Stereotypes Is Forbidden  
   – Congressprohibited reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No findings here link micro‐dosed amphetamine to increased flight risk or violence.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search  
   – Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  

2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
   – Absent individualized suspicion or special‐needs justification, suspicionless drug tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
   – Massachusetts demands reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
  – “Liberty is the norm,” pre‐trial restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
  – Massachusetts law bars “excessive bail,” including overly restrictive conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential medication or non‐compliance are “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Fourteenth Amendment Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy  
   – A detainee has a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
   – Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
   – Due process requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  
   – The District Court issued no such findings.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  
  – MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to the only effective medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
  – MERA is to be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
  – Section 58 permits only the “least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
  – The court made no findings linking micro‐dosed amphetamine to non‐appearance or danger and ignored less‐restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief and Injunctive‐Relief Standards  
  – Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC‐13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).  
  – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
     1. Likelihood of success—overwhelming here on statutory and constitutional grounds;  
     2. Irreparable harm—forced cessation of essential medication inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury. Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35;  
     3. Balance of equities—stable treatment advances public safety, whereas forced discontinuation heightens risk;  
     4. Public interest—ensuring compliance with disability laws and equal access to justice is paramount.

H. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Pre‐Trial Punishment  
  – Pre‐trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punitive measures, not legitimate regulatory safeguards.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro‐dosing of amphetamine under less‐restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
