COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two pre-trial conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:

• Deny Petitioner reasonable accommodation for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine;  
• Rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger; and  
• Violates:  
  – Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, .139;  
  – § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  – Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
  – Fourth Amendment/Art. 14;  
  – Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause/Art. 26;  
  – Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process; and  
  – G. L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement.

No adequate remedy exists below; immediate superintendence relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel proffered Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert report. The District Court nevertheless imposed the blanket drug ban and random urinalysis without any medical or threat-risk findings.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified individuals from “programs” it offers. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).

2. Denial of Reasonable Modification: DOJ regs require an “individualized assessment” before excluding necessary medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court imposed a per se ban on “any illegal drugs,” foreclosing Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment without inquiry.

3. Blanket Bans Are Unlawful: Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or “fundamentally alters” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ-Mass. Trial Ct. 2022 Settlement expressly bars pre-trial blanket medication bans.

4. Stereotypes Forbidden: Congress found that “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No medical evidence supports a finding that micro-dosed amphetamine increases flight risk or violence.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
1. Random urinalysis is a “search.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Suspicionless testing is unreasonable absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm,” and any condition that effectively coerces detention is “excessive.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Forcing Petitioner to choose between discontinuation of essential medication (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) is excessive.

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Pre-trial detainees have a liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996).  
2. Procedural: At minimum, due process requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against the need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court made none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G. L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denial of access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. ABUSE OF DISCRETION UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58  
Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Billerica Police Dep’t, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: likelihood of success (overwhelming here); irreparable harm (forced cessation inflicts irreversible injury); balance of equities (stable treatment promotes safety); and public interest (upholding disability rights and equal justice).

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
