COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks this Court’s superintendence power, G.L. c. 211, § 3, to VACATE two pre-trial conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  

1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:  

• Deny a reasonable accommodation under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) for Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1);  
• Rest on no individualized findings of direct threat, violence, or flight risk as required by 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b) and Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024);  
• Violate Petitioner’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989)) by authorizing random, suspicionless testing;  
• Breach the Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017)) and G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirement (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016));  
• Offend substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976)); and  
• Violates the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004)).  

Immediate relief is required to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
This Court’s Single-Justice session has authority to vacate bail orders that infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 provides the exclusive vehicle. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
• September 26, 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• July 17, 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies relief without written findings.  
• December 2, 2025: Scheduled trial.  

No timely appeal or habeas remedy can avert the daily irreparable harm of forced medication cessation.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without any individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner has severe, documented ADHD unresponsive to non-stimulant therapies; only micro-dosed amphetamine—strictly monitored by his treating psychiatrist—maintains stable cognitive and occupational functioning (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel submitted Petitioner’s valid prescription and medical evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed:

• A total ban on “any illegal drugs,” encompassing his prescribed amphetamine;  
• A mandate of random, suspicionless urinalysis.

No medical testimony, direct-threat analysis, or written findings justified these measures.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & SECTION 504 VIOLATIONS  
1. Coverage: Title II prohibits public entities from denying qualified individuals the benefits of their “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004). Section 504 is coextensive. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Reasonable Modification Required: DOJ regulations mandate an “individualized assessment” of disability-related accommodations before exclusion. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban on amphetamine, Petitioner’s sole effective therapy, denies meaningful access to pre-trial release.  
3. Blanket Bans Prohibited: Exclusion of prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or “fundamentally alter[s]” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined analogous bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). The DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars blanket pre-trial medication bans.[9]  
4. No Stereotypes: Congress found reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). Here no evidence connects micro-dosed amphetamine with risk.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14 VIOLATIONS  
Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. at 617; Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78. Without individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, suspicionless drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions coercing either withdrawal of essential medication (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive: Detainees enjoy a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural: Due process demands written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s need for treatment against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were issued.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT VIOLATION  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004). Denying Petitioner access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 ABUSE OF DISCRETION  
Section 58 mandates bail conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTION STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; and (4) public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions function as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
