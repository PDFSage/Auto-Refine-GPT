Petitioner Bo Shang respectfully invokes this Court’s superintendence power, G. L. c. 211, § 3, to vacate the Woburn District Court’s September 26, 2024 bail order (Dkt. No. 5531568), which (1) categorically bans “any illegal drugs” and (2) mandates random, suspicionless urinalysis as conditions of pre-trial release. These conditions are unlawful for multiple, independent reasons:

I. TITLE II OF THE ADA & SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT
  A. Coverage: 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Judicial processes—including bail—are “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).
  B. Reasonable Modification: 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) require an individualized assessment before excluding a necessary accommodation. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). Here, the court applied a per se ban on amphetamine—Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—without inquiry.
  C. Blanket‐Ban Prohibition: A public entity must first find, on current medical evidence, that the accommodation poses a “direct threat” or “fundamental alteration.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, ___ F. App’x ___, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); DOJ–Mass. Trial Ct. 2022 Settlement (§§ 2–9).

II. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ARTICLE 14
  A. Random urinalysis is a “search.” Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).
  B. Without individualized suspicion or “special needs,” suspicionless drug tests are unreasonable. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2016).

III. EIGHTH AMENDMENT, ARTICLE 26 & EXCESSIVE BAIL
  Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017). These conditions effectively coerce detention or discontinuation of essential treatment—both “excessive.”

IV. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS
  A. Substantive Liberty: Protected bodily integrity interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618 (1996).
  B. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against Petitioner’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

V. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G. L. c. 93, § 103
  Prohibits any disability discrimination. Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758 (1997).

VI. G. L. c. 276, § 58 (“Least Restrictive” Bail Standard)
  Conditions must be narrowly tailored. Diggs v. Commonwealth, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro‐dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less‐restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson v. Commonwealth, 476 Mass. 163 (2017); Durling v. Commonwealth, 407 Mass. 108 (1990).

VII. SUPERINTENDENCE AND INJUNCTION STANDARDS
  A. Superintendence: A Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Billerica Police Dep’t, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).
  B. Winter Factors: (1) Likelihood of success—overwhelming; (2) Irreparable harm—forced medication cessation causes irreversible harm; (3) Balance—stable treatment promotes public safety; (4) Public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access to justice.

VIII. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE
  Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520; Stack, 342 U.S. 1.

RELIEF REQUESTED
  1. VACATE the categorical drug ban and random-testing requirement.  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting prescribed micro-dosed amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring.  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court.  
  4. GRANT any further relief to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
