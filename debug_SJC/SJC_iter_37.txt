COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), challenges two conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:  
  • Deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger, in violation of Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794)[1];  
  • Contravene the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103[2];  
  • Impose unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights[3];  
  • Inflict “excessive” bail conditions contrary to the Eighth Amendment, Art. 26, and G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” standard[4];  
  • Violate substantive and procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Arts. 12, 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights[5].  

No adequate remedy exists below; immediate superintendence relief is required to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 supplies the remedy. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025: Trial scheduled; absent relief, Petitioner faces irreparable harm.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers from severe dopamine-deficit ADHD controlled only by micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1: Oct. 2024 neuropsych. report, Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH). At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and expert report; the District Court nonetheless imposed a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and random testing without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Whether a categorical ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violates Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and due-process guarantees.  
2. Whether suspicionless random urinalysis violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
3. Whether these conditions are an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief.

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. Title II of the ADA & § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Coverage: Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified disabled individuals from their “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Reasonable Modification Required: DOJ regulations mandate an “individualized assessment” before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court’s per se ban forecloses Petitioner’s only effective therapy.  
3. Blanket Bans Unlawful: Excluding prescribed medication requires specific evidence-based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or “fundamentally alter[s]” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, ___ F. App’x ___, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar policies. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court similarly bars blanket medication bans.[9]  
4. Stereotypes Forbidden: Congress found “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).[33] The District Court made no findings that micro-dosed amphetamine increases risk.

B. Fourth Amendment & Art. 14 Violations  
1. Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Suspicionless testing is unreasonable without individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing cessation of essential medication—or non-compliance (and detention)—are “excessive.”

D. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., conc.).  
2. Procedural: Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the individual’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. Massachusetts Equal Rights Act Violations  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. Abuse of Discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Section 58 requires bail conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence & Injunctive-Relief Standards  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992)); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; and (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punitive measures, not legitimate regulatory safeguards.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
