COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang seeks vacatur of two pre-trial release conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  

1. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs”; and  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions:

• Deny a reasonable accommodation under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12132) and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) for Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD, controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine;  
• Rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger;  
• Violate the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (and Arts. 14, 26, 12 of the Mass. Declaration of Rights);  
• Contravene G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that bail conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary; and  
• Breach the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (G. L. c. 93, § 103).  

No adequate remedy exists in the trial court or on appeal; irreparable harm is imminent. Petitioner invokes this Court’s superintendence power, G. L. c. 211, § 3, and SJC Rule 2:22.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate a bail order that infringes constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025). When no other adequate remedy exists, G. L. c. 211, § 3 provides relief.

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court enters the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; no other timely remedy exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers from severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his cognition and behavior (Exhibit 1). At arraignment, counsel presented a valid prescription and medical evidence. The court nonetheless imposed a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical ban on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does mandatory suspicionless urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage. Title II bars any public entity from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from its “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794; Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Bail and pre-trial supervision are “programs.” Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).  
2. Reasonable Modification Required. DOJ regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), § 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The District Court imposed a per se ban on amphetamine—Petitioner’s only effective treatment—without any inquiry.  
3. Blanket Bans Prohibited. A public entity may exclude prescribed medication only after specific findings, based on current medical evidence, that it poses a direct threat or fundamentally alters the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court likewise bars blanket pre-trial medication prohibitions.  
4. Myths and Stereotypes Forbidden. Congress found that reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). Here, no evidence links micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or danger.

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
1. Search. Compulsory urinalysis is a search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  
2. Unreasonable Without Suspicion. Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs justification, random drug testing violates the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). These conditions force Petitioner either to discontinue essential medication (risking decompensation) or to violate the ban (risking detention)—both “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive. Detainees have a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural. Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against the individual’s need for treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT, G.L. c. 93, § 103  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. Denying access to the only effective medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 (“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”)  
Bail conditions must be the least restrictive means of ensuring appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
A Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Under Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), Petitioner shows (1) likelihood of success; (2) irreparable harm from forced treatment cessation (Riggins, 504 U.S. at 134–35); (3) balance of equities favors stable treatment; and (4) public interest in enforcing disability rights and equal justice.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions are punitive, not regulatory.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
