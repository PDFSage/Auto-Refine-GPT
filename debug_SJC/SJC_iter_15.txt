COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A, seeks this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3 to vacate two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  a. A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  b. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions deny Petitioner reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine (Oct. 2024 neuropsych. report, Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH)—and were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:  
  1. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
  2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004);  
  3. Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004);  
  4. Fourth Amendment; Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001);  
  5. Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail Clause; United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017);  
  6. Fourteenth Amendment substantive/procedural due process; Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003); Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618 (1996);  
  7. G. L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard; Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70 (2020).  

No adequate alternative remedy exists. Immediate relief is necessary to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
  • 26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court (No. 5531568) imposes the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial scheduled for 2 Dec 2025; no timely alternative relief is available.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report (Exhibit 1) confirms severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel produced a valid prescription and expert evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed (a) a blanket ban on “any illegal drugs” and (b) random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
  2. Does mandatory suspicionless urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
  1. Title II/§ 504 Apply to Pre-trial Release. The ADA bars any public entity from denying qualified individuals the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities” it offers. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794. Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010).  
  2. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Modification. DOJ regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban on “any illegal drugs” forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment without inquiry.  
  3. Blanket Bans Are Per Se Unlawful. Title II prohibits categorical exclusions absent evidence-based findings of direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Federal courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket medication bans.  
  4. Reliance on Stereotypes Is Forbidden. Congress found that “[h]istorical reliance on myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability is itself harmful. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). No findings here link micro-dosed amphetamine to risk.

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  
  1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001).  
  2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable. Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, suspicionless tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997). Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
  • “Liberty is the norm”; restraint is the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951).  
  • Massachusetts bars “excessive bail” and conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Forcing Petitioner to choose between decompensation (cessation of essential treatment) or non-compliance (detention) is “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  
  1. Substantive Liberty in Medical Autonomy. Detainees have a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003). Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy. Brosnahan v. Commonwealth, 421 Mass. 618 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90 (2018).  
  2. Procedural Due Process. Requires written, specific findings balancing State interests against the right to treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). The District Court issued none.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act  
  • MERA prohibits disability discrimination by any person. G. L. c. 93, § 103. Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004). MERA must be liberally construed. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
  • Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020).  
  • The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief and Injunctive-Relief Standards  
  • A Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5.  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced cessation inflicts irreversible injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35); (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; (4) public interest—enforcing disability rights and equal justice.

H. Pre-Trial Punishment and Presumption of Innocence  
  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6. The challenged conditions operate as punishment.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
