COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IN RE BO SHANG,  
      Petitioner  
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

         ABSOLUTE, INDEFINITE, AND IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO COMPLY  
          WITH ALL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS – DECLARATION AT THE OUTSET  

TO THE HONORABLE COURT AND ALL READERS:

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby makes, in the most unmistakable and emphatic terms, his absolute, perpetual, and unwavering commitment to obey every single pretrial condition imposed by the Woburn District Court in Case No. 5531568—without modification, evasion, or exception—for as long as those conditions remain in force. Petitioner neither challenges nor underestimates the court’s authority; he does not dispute, repudiate, or attempt to circumvent any term of his pretrial release. He solemnly pledges continued, indefinite adherence to every requirement—attending all court dates, responding to all reporting or monitoring obligations, and complying fully with every directive—unless and until a higher court of competent jurisdiction modifies or vacates any portion thereof.

This declaration is neither theoretical nor qualified. It is a binding, on-the-record promise, designed to remove any doubt about Petitioner’s respect for and deference to the courts. By seeking only a narrowly tailored, legally compelled accommodation—namely, permission to maintain his micro-dose amphetamine prescription for severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—Petitioner aims to reconcile his complete cooperation with the medically necessary regimen that underlies his day-to-day functioning. No other pretrial condition is questioned or resisted. Petitioner stands ready to fulfill and exceed all obligations, while urging the Court, for the reasons that follow, to grant the specific relief necessary to remedy an unconstitutional and unlawful ban that conflicts with his acknowledged medical disability.

    PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
      EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRETRIAL CONDITIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. INTRODUCTION

By invoking this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power, see G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully petitions for an immediate order vacating—or suitably tailoring—two pretrial-release conditions imposed on September 26, 2024, in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568, that (1) institute a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and (2) mandate random urinalysis under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Petitioner does not contest the Court’s broad authority to impose conditions designed to ensure appearance and public safety. Rather, the unyielding prohibition at issue effectively forbids Petitioner’s sole effective medication for a diagnosable disability—severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—without individualized findings or narrow tailoring. As applied to Petitioner, this prohibition contravenes:

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
• The Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103.  
• Constitutional provisions safeguarding bodily integrity, due process, and prohibiting excessive bail or searches without suspicion, including the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  
• The statutory requirement under G. L. c. 276, § 58, that pretrial conditions reflect the “least restrictive” means consistent with ensuring a defendant’s appearance and addressing any danger to the public.

It is well-settled—both locally and nationally—that courts should not categorically ban duly prescribed medication absent a specific and evidence-based showing of risk. See, e.g., Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *17–19 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Because Petitioner cannot wait until post-trial appeals to reinstate the only medically validated treatment for his ADHD, and the Middlesex Superior Court has summarily declined to intervene, extraordinary superintendence relief is warranted. See Dickerson v. Attorney Gen., 396 Mass. 740, 743 (1986) (invoking extraordinary relief under G. L. c. 211, § 3 where no other timely remedy exists).

II. JURISDICTION

This Court (via single-justice session or the full bench) exercises broad authority to review bail orders under G. L. c. 211, § 3. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). When no “other remedy” adequately addresses an ongoing and significant constitutional or statutory violation—and irreparable harm looms—superintendence relief is appropriate. See Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005). Because the Superior Court summarily declined to provide relief, Petitioner’s trial remains months away, and his disability-related medication is blocked, there is no viable alternative remedy short of this Court’s urgent intervention.

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On September 26, 2024, Petitioner was arraigned in Woburn District Court (Case No. 5531568) for assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A. The court imposed standard conditions, including “no illegal drugs” and random urinalysis. These were applied indiscriminately, with no accommodation or exception for Petitioner’s documented medical prescription.  
2. On July 17, 2025, Petitioner moved in the Middlesex Superior Court to clarify or modify those conditions, supporting his request with an October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation verifying severe dopamine-deficit ADHD and the well-documented necessity of micro-dose amphetamine therapy. The Superior Court issued a summary denial without findings.  
3. Trial is set for December 2, 2025, leaving Petitioner to endure months of forced discontinuation of the sole medication that stabilizes his condition.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether a flat ban on “any illegal drugs,” applied to bar Petitioner’s lawfully prescribed ADHD medication, violates the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, MERA, and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (and corresponding provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights).  
2. Whether the District Court’s imposition of these conditions—absent any individualized findings linking Petitioner’s medication to flight risk or community danger—constitutes an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, justifying immediate superintendence relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner incorporates by reference his Superior Court submissions (dated July 17, 2025), specifically including:

• The October 2024 neuropsychological evaluation by Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH (Exhibit 1), confirming Petitioner’s severe dopamine-deficit ADHD.  
• Documentation that no other medication besides micro-dose amphetamine (prescribed under physician monitoring protocols) adequately addresses Petitioner’s cognitive deficits and attention issues.  
• Evidence that, as a direct consequence of suspending this medication, Petitioner has suffered diminished focus, impeded employment opportunities, and substantial mental stress—a period of ongoing, irreparable harm.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE FEDERAL DISABILITY RIGHTS STATUTES

1. TITLE II OF THE ADA PRECLUDES BLANKET POLICIES THAT DEPRIVE DISABLED PERSONS OF NEEDED MEDICATION

Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134, bars any public entity—here, the state court system—from denying the benefits of services, programs, or activities on account of a qualified disability. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004). Pretrial conditions plainly qualify as a “program or activity.” See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999) (requiring individualized accommodation in public programs). Federal regulations mandate “reasonable modifications” unless a fundamental alteration or direct threat would result. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). Prohibiting indiscriminately “all drugs” without distinguishing a defendant’s lawfully prescribed medication is precisely the sort of blanket exclusion that courts have invalidated under the ADA. Theriault, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *19–20 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024) (faulting “one-size-fits-all” approach).

2. SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT REQUIRES THE SAME ACCOMMODATION

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), bars discrimination “under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” Massachusetts trial courts receive such assistance; therefore, they must accommodate a known disability in bail decisions. Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir. 2019). Treating Petitioner’s medically prescribed amphetamine as though it were a street drug—without individualized findings—deprives him of a necessary aid to mitigate his disability. This is a textbook violation of § 504.

B. THE CONDITIONS OFFEND FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES

1. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS AND BODILY INTEGRITY

The Constitution has long recognized a liberty interest in bodily integrity, encompassing medical decision-making. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229 (1990). While Harper often arises in forcible-medication contexts, the operative principle—whether the government unconstitutionally intrudes on essential medical care—applies equally to a blanket prohibition that denies a defendant the sole treatment for a serious condition. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992). Petitioner endures an impermissible intrusion upon his bodily integrity—effectively forcing him to forego crucial treatment for ADHD with no individualized justification.

2. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT AND ARTICLE 14 PROSCRIBE BLANKET, SUSPICIONLESS SEARCHES (RANDOM URINALYSIS)

Random urinalysis constitutes a search under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617–18 (1989). Courts require either individualized suspicion or a demonstrable “special need” to justify suspicionless testing. Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 76–77 (2001). No special need or flight/danger link has been asserted; the District Court simply imposed a “random testing” condition as a matter of routine. Under Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, such suspicionless searches are similarly unreasonable unless narrowly confined. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

3. THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT AND ARTICLE 26 FORBID EXCESSIVE OR PUNITIVE BAIL CONDITIONS

Pretrial conditions cannot be punitive. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746–47 (1987). Bail must strictly serve regulatory aims—ensuring presence at trial and protecting public safety—without imposing undue hardship. Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4–5 (1951). Under the Massachusetts Constitution, Article 26 outlaws “excessive bail” or conditions causing gratuitous harm. Commonwealth v. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 700–02 (2017). Forbidding the only treatment that sustains Petitioner’s cognitive function imposes an excessive, punitive burden wholly unrelated to any proven flight risk.

4. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS IS DEFEATED BY THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Even if potentially warranted in some factual scenarios, such a sweeping restriction demands on-record findings explaining why Petitioner’s prescription presents a flight or public-safety concern. Commonwealth v. Walsh, 485 Mass. 567, 573–74 (2020). The District Court’s failure to articulate any basis for conflating medically prescribed amphetamine with disqualifying “drug use” violates Petitioner’s right to a process that is meaningful and individualized. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).

C. THE MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT IS VIOLATED

MERA, G. L. c. 93, § 103, codifies “a broad guarantee of equality” for disabled persons. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851 (2004). A blanket ban that forces Petitioner to discontinue essential ADHD medication punishes him simply due to his disability. Because MERA must be “liberally construed” to eliminate such discrimination, Bain v. City of Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997), the District Court’s order offends this statute.

D. THE BLANKET BAN VIOLATES THE “LEAST RESTRICTIVE” PRINCIPLE UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58

Under Massachusetts law, bail conditions must be no more restrictive than needed to ensure a defendant’s appearance and public safety. G. L. c. 276, § 58; Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). Courts must explore whether less onerous conditions—here, for example, verifying a legitimate prescription with a licensed physician, imposing medication supervision, or requiring partial waivers—could achieve the same objectives. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 88–89 (2016). Prohibiting Petitioner from a needed prescription with no attempt at flexibility is an abuse of the District Court’s discretion. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017) (emphasizing requirement of individualized findings).

E. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS BOTH NECESSARY AND PROPER

General Laws c. 211, § 3 grants this Court extraordinary power to correct abuses or errors in lower courts when no adequate remedy exists. Dickerson, 396 Mass. at 743. Petitioner’s daily deprivation of critical ADHD medication is neither abstract nor reparable after the fact. The Superior Court summarily refused to act, leaving Petitioner’s health and fundamental rights in jeopardy for months to come. These circumstances epitomize the need for immediate superintendence relief.

F. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FACTORS (WINTER V. NRDC) SUPPORT EXPEDITED RELIEF

1. Likelihood of Success: Petitioner’s position is founded on a robust matrix of controlling precedents condemning categorical bans of medically necessary prescriptions.  
2. Irreparable Harm: Without his medication, Petitioner endures palpable cognitive, emotional, and vocational harm that accumulates daily and cannot be fully undone post-trial.  
3. Balance of Equities: The government’s legitimate interests can be fully protected through narrowly tailored approaches; Petitioner’s interests in disability accommodation and fundamental constitutional rights plainly outweigh the cost of such minor adjustments.  
4. Public Interest: Upholding civil-rights protections in bail conditions promotes public confidence in the justice system, maintaining fairness while preserving public safety.

G. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE PROHIBITS PRETRIAL PUNITIVE RESTRAINTS

“A defendant may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535. Eliminating Petitioner’s sole treatment option for ADHD—devoid of evidence that it endangers anyone—unjustifiably penalizes him and presumes wrongdoing inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays that the Court:

1. IMMEDIATELY VACATE, or at minimum STAY, the blanket “no illegal drugs” and random urinalysis conditions to the extent they disallow or penalize Petitioner’s prescribed micro-dose amphetamine in Woburn District Court Case No. 5531568.  
2. REMAND with clear instructions that the District Court:  
   (a) Undertake an individualized, on-the-record inquiry into whether Petitioner’s clinically prescribed medication poses flight or public-safety concerns;  
   (b) Impose any necessary conditions using the “least restrictive” principle under G. L. c. 276, § 58;  
   (c) Comply with the ADA, § 504, MERA, and constitutional principles limiting searches, excessive bail, and recognition of bodily integrity; and  
   (d) Make explicit findings before infringing Petitioner’s medical necessity.  
3. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, REPORT these critical constitutional and statutory questions to the full Supreme Judicial Court to set statewide precedent.  
4. AWARD any other emergency or equitable relief—such as an expedited hearing—to prevent further irreparable harm.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

The daily harm Petitioner experiences from forced discontinuation of his prescribed medication is not conjectural; it is real, severe, and accumulating. With trial still months away, delay magnifies the damage. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully implores the Court for an expedited schedule or immediate preliminary relief to alleviate this ongoing violation.
