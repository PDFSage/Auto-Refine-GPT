COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), invokes the Court’s superintendence power, G.L. c. 211, § 3, to vacate two bail conditions imposed by the Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  

1. A blanket ban on “any illegal drugs.”  
2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

Those conditions (a) deny Petitioner his only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) were imposed absent any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and implementing regs (28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a));  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103;  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 and the Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail-condition requirement (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No other adequate remedy exists, and immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm to Petitioner’s health and ability to participate in his defense.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). Where no timely alternative remedy exists, G.L. c. 211, § 3 provides relief. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court enters bail conditions challenged here.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025: Trial scheduled.  

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH). Only micro-dosed amphetamine controls his symptoms. At arraignment, counsel proffered Petitioner’s valid prescription and expert evidence. The court nonetheless imposed (1) a total ban on all illegal drugs and (2) random urinalysis without any medical or risk assessment.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  
1. Title II/§ 504 Cover Bail and Pre-Trial Release. Title II bars public entities from excluding qualified disabled persons from their “programs.” Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 parallels Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  
2. Denial of Reasonable Modification. DOJ regs require an individualized inquiry before excluding necessary medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014). The court’s per se ban on amphetamine denies Petitioner meaningful access to pre-trial release.  
3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Unlawful. Excluding prescribed medication requires evidence-based findings that it poses a “direct threat” or “fundamentally alters” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019). DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket medication prohibitions.  
4. Stereotypes Prohibited. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) forbids reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. No evidence supports that micro-dosed amphetamine increases risk.

B. Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 Violations  
Random, suspicionless urinalysis is a Fourth Amendment “search.” Skinner, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001). Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs showing, such testing is unreasonable. Vernonia Sch. Dist.47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997); Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail Violations  
“Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). Massachusetts likewise bars “excessive bail or conditions” that coerce detention. Brangan, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing discontinuation of essential medication (risking decompensation) or non-compliance (and detention) are excessive.

D. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Violations  
1. Substantive: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003); Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018).  
2. Procedural: Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interests against Petitioner’s need for treatment. Mathews, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979). None were made.

E. Massachusetts Equal Rights Act Violations  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” G.L. c. 93, § 103; Shedlock, 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004); Bain, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997). Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. Abuse of Discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58  
Section 58 demands bail conditions be the least restrictive necessary. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020). The court made no risk findings regarding micro-dosed amphetamine and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief & Injunctive Standards  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  1. Likelihood of success—overwhelming here;  
  2. Irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35 (1992));  
  3. Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety;  
  4. Public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence  
Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punitive measures.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  
  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
