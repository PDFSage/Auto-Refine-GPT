COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE-JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), challenges two pre-trial conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable modification for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine (Exhibit 1)—and (b) were imposed without individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

- Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132,[1] and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
- Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
- Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
- Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments; Articles 14, 26, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
- G. L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail-condition standard.

Immediate superintendence relief is required under G. L. c. 211, § 3 to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002); see Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court enters bail conditions challenged here.  
17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; no other adequate remedy exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s Oct 2024 neuropsych. report (Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel provided a valid prescription and expert evidence. The District Court nonetheless imposed the blanket drug ban and random urinalysis absent any medical, behavioral or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504, MERA, and due-process guarantees?  
2. Does mandatory suspicionless urinalysis violate Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. The Conditions Violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  

1. Title II/§ 504 Apply to Pre-Trial Release  
   – Title II forbids public entities from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from their “services, programs, or activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
   – Judicial processes, including bail, are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).

2. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Modification  
   – Regulations require an individualized assessment before excluding needed medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999); Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
   – A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” forecloses Petitioner’s only effective treatment without any inquiry.

3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Per Se Unlawful  
   – Title II prohibits per se exclusions absent a direct-threat or fundamental-alteration finding. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).  
   – Federal courts have enjoined similar policies: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
   – The DOJ’s 2022 settlement with the Massachusetts Trial Court bars pre-trial blanket bans.

4. No Evidence of Direct Threat  
   – The District Court made no medical or factual findings that micro-dosed amphetamine increases flight risk or danger, relying instead on forbidden “myths, fears, and stereotypes.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. The Conditions Violate the Fourth Amendment and Article 14  

1. Random Urinalysis Is a Search  
   – Compulsory drug testing is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).

2. Suspicionless Testing Is Unreasonable  
   – Absent individualized suspicion or special-needs findings, suspicionless drug tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
   – Massachusetts requires reasonable suspicion for probationary searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment, Article 26, and the Excessive Bail Clause  
   – Pre-trial liberty is the norm; restraint is the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
   – Massachusetts bars “excessive” bail and conditions tantamount to detention. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017). Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  

1. Substantive Due Process—Bodily Integrity  
   – Pre-trial detainees have a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
   – Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a liberty interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
   – Requires written, specific findings balancing Petitioner’s treatment needs against any legitimate government interest. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  
   – The District Court issued no such findings.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103  
   – MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
   – MERA must be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  
   – Conditions must be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
   – The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives—verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence and Injunctive-Relief Standards  
   – Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders causing substantial infringement of rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones, slip op. at 4–5.  
   – Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires: (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury; (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes public safety; (4) public interest—enforcing disability rights and equal access to justice is paramount.

H. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Pre-Trial Punishment  
   – Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions function as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to fashion a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT such further relief as justice requires, including expedited consideration to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm.
