COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks immediate vacatur of two September 26, 2024 bail conditions (Woburn Docket No. 5531568):  
  1. Categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,”  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

Those conditions deny Petitioner’s only effective ADHD treatment—medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a) (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
• § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
• Fourth Amendment/Art. 14—unreasonable search (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Eighth Amendment/Excessive Bail/Art. 26 (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
• Fourteenth Amendment due process—substantive liberty in medical autonomy (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)) and procedural due process (Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979));  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” bail standard (Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).

Immediate intervention is required to prevent irreparable cognitive, psychological, and vocational harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
G.L. c. 211, § 3 authorizes a Single Justice to vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights when no adequate alternative remedy exists. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454 (2002); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
• 26 Sep 2024: Woburn District Court imposes challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• 2 Dec 2025: Trial scheduled; absent relief, ongoing irreparable harm ensues.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner’s October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH) documents severe ADHD responsive only to micro-dosed amphetamine. At arraignment, counsel submitted a valid prescription and medical evidence, yet the court banned all “illegal drugs,” including his medication, and ordered random urinalysis without medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
1. Does a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate the ADA, § 504, MERA, and due process?  
2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Art. 14?  
3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G.L. c. 276, § 58?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. ADA & REHABILITATION ACT  
• Title II (§ 12132) and § 504 (§ 794) cover bail. Tennessee v. Lane; Pa. Dep’t of Corr.  
• 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a) require an individualized assessment before excluding prescribed medication. Olmstead; Nunes.  
• Blanket bans are per se unlawful absent findings that medication poses a direct threat or fundamentally alters the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault; Smith v. Aroostook Cnty.; Pesce; Kortlever.  
• Reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” is forbidden. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT/ART. 14  
• Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner; Ferguson.  
• Without individualized suspicion or special-needs justification, it is unreasonable. Vernonia; Chandler; Ferrer.

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL/ART. 26  
• “Liberty is the norm; restraint the exception.” Salerno; Stack; Brangan.  
• Conditions forcing discontinuation of essential treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are excessive.

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
• Substantive liberty protects medical autonomy. Harper; Riggins; Sell; Brosnahan; Eldred.  
• Procedural due process requires written, specific findings balancing state interests and treatment needs. Mathews; Gagnon; Bell.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
• MERA forbids disability discrimination by any person. Shedlock; Bain. Denial of essential medication is per se discriminatory.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58—LEAST RESTRICTIVE  
• Bail conditions must be narrowly tailored. Diggs; Lougee.  
• Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives (prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers). Peterson; Durling.

G. EXTRAORDINARY SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCTIVE STANDARDS  
• G.L. c. 211, § 3 empowers a Single Justice to vacate orders infringing substantive rights. Laurie; Votta; Jones.  
• Under Winter, Petitioner meets all factors: likelihood of success (overwhelming statutory and constitutional violations); irreparable harm (forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible injury, Riggins); balance of equities (stable treatment promotes safety); public interest (ensuring disability rights and equal justice).

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
• Pre-trial detainees may not be punished before conviction. Bell; Stack. The challenged conditions are punitive in effect.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
