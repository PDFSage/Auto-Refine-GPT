COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two pre-trial release conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024:  
  • A categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  • Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions unlawfully (a) deny Petitioner reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—controlled only by medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) were imposed without any individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

  1. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and DOJ regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.139;  
  2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  
  3. Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), G. L. c. 93, § 103;  
  4. Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and Articles 14, 26, and 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and  
  5. G. L. c. 276, § 58’s requirement that conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary.

No other adequate remedy exists; immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no other adequate remedy exists, relief lies under G. L. c. 211, § 3. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4–5 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  
  • 26 Sep 2024: District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
  • 17 Jul 2025: Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
  • Trial set for 2 Dec 2025; no timely alternative exists.

IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
Petitioner suffers from severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report from Worcester Recovery Center & Hospital/DMH. Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his functioning. At arraignment, counsel presented the prescription and expert evidence. The court nonetheless imposed a total ban on “any illegal drugs” and random urinalysis without any medical, behavioral, or risk-assessment findings.

V. QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
  1. Does a blanket prohibition on “any illegal drugs,” imposed without individualized findings, violate Title II of the ADA, Section 504, MERA, and due process?  
  2. Does suspicionless random urinalysis violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?  
  3. Do these conditions constitute an abuse of discretion under G. L. c. 276, § 58, warranting superintendence relief?

VI. ARGUMENT  

A. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act Prohibit Blanket Medication Bans  

1. Title II/§ 504 Cover Pre-Trial Release Conditions  
  • Title II bars any “public entity” from denying qualified individuals with disabilities the “benefits of the services, programs, or activities” it offers. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794.  
  • Judicial processes, including bail and release conditions, are “programs” under Title II. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527–29 (2004); Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1067–69 (9th Cir. 2010); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19–20 (1st Cir. 2004).  

2. Denial of the Required Individualized Assessment  
  • DOJ regulations mandate an “individualized assessment” before excluding disability-related medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), 35.139(a).  
  • In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 603 (1999), the Supreme Court held that blanket policies excluding disabled individuals without case-by-case analysis violate Title II. The First Circuit applied the same rule in Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 143–44 (1st Cir. 2014).  
  • Here, the District Court imposed a categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” precluding Petitioner’s only effective treatment—micro-dosed amphetamine—without any medical or threat-risk inquiry.

3. Blanket Medication Bans Are Per Se Unlawful Absent Direct-Threat Findings  
  • To exclude a prescribed medication, a public entity must first find, on current medical evidence, that it poses a “direct threat” to safety or would “fundamentally alter” the program. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b).  
  • Theriault v. Flynn, No. 23-1588, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *12–13 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024), holds that any categorical exclusion of necessary medication violates Title II absent such findings.  
  • Federal courts have enjoined similar bans: Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41, 53–55 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 47–49 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., No. 2:18-cv-823-JLR, 2019 WL 2179222, at *4–6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 29, 2019).  
  • The Department of Justice’s 2022 Settlement Agreement with the Massachusetts Trial Court expressly prohibits pre-trial blanket medication bans.

4. Prohibition on Myths, Fears, and Stereotypes  
  • Congress forbade reliance on unfounded stereotypes about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7). The District Court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to flight risk or violence.

B. The Categorical Drug Ban and Random Urinalysis Violate the Fourth Amendment  

1. Random Urinalysis Constitutes a Search  
  • Compulsory drug testing is a search under Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989), and Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77–78 (2001).  

2. Unreasonable Without Individualized Justification  
  • Absent individualized suspicion or a special-needs justification, suspicionless drug tests violate the Fourth Amendment. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652–53 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 319 (1997).  
  • Massachusetts law demands at least reasonable suspicion for probation searches. Commonwealth v. Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252–53 (2016).

C. The Conditions Violate the Eighth Amendment and the Excessive Bail Clause  

  • Pre-trial liberty is the norm; restraint is the exception. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754–55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951).  
  • Massachusetts bars “excessive bail,” including unduly onerous conditions. Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691, 698–700 (2017).  
  • Conditions forcing either cessation of essential treatment (risking mental decompensation) or non-compliance (and pre-trial detention) are “excessive.”

D. The Conditions Violate Substantive and Procedural Due Process  

1. Substantive Due Process—Bodily Integrity  
  • There is a protected liberty interest in avoiding forced withdrawal of prescribed medication. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229–31 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135–36 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178–80 (2003).  
  • Massachusetts recognizes medical autonomy as a protected interest. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626–27 (1996); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 102–04 (2018) (Lenk, J., concurring).

2. Procedural Due Process  
  • Due process requires written, specific findings balancing the State’s interest against Petitioner’s right to treatment. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334–35 (1976); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790–91 (1973); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979).  
  • The District Court issued no such findings.

E. The Conditions Violate the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G. L. c. 93, § 103  

  • MERA prohibits disability discrimination “by any person.” Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851–52 (2004).  
  • MERA must be “liberally construed.” Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766–67 (1997).

F. The Conditions Are an Abuse of Discretion Under G. L. c. 276, § 58  

  • Section 58 requires conditions to be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and safety. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87–89 (2016); Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75–77 (2020).  
  • The court made no findings linking micro-dosed amphetamine to any risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives: verified prescription monitoring, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic dispensers. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172–73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112–13 (1990).

G. Extraordinary Superintendence Relief and Injunctive Factors  

  • Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders that substantially infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005); Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).  
  • Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires (1) likelihood of success—overwhelming here; (2) irreparable harm—forced treatment cessation inflicts irreversible cognitive, psychological, and vocational injury; (3) balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety; and (4) public interest—ensuring disability rights and equal access to justice.

H. Presumption of Innocence and Prohibition on Pre-Trial Punishment  

  • Pre-trial detainees may not be punished prior to conviction. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535–37 (1979); Stack, 342 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1951). The challenged conditions operate as punishment, not regulation.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

  1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
  2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
  3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
  4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
