STATEMENT OF FULL COMPLIANCE WITH PRETRIAL CONDITIONS

Petitioner, Mr. Bo Shang, hereby makes clear and unequivocal his commitment to comply with all pretrial release conditions. He pledges to adhere scrupulously and indefinitely to each and every condition imposed by the Woburn District Court, without exception, unless and until he obtains relief from a higher court having proper jurisdiction. Mr. Shang does not seek to avoid or circumvent any condition ordered by the District Court; rather, he seeks only the narrow and legally required accommodation that allows him continued access to the medically necessary, lawfully prescribed micro-dose amphetamine essential for his documented and severe dopamine-deficit ADHD.

PETITION PURSUANT TO G. L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22 FOR
EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to this Court’s extraordinary superintendence power under G. L. c. 211, § 3, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court vacate the portion of the Woburn District Court’s Order in Case No. 5531568 (entered 26 September 2024) imposing (1) a categorical prohibition on “any illegal drugs” and (2) mandatory random urinalysis, as conditions of pre-trial release under G. L. c. 276, § 58. Although Petitioner stands ready and willing to observe all conditions set by the Court—and will continue to do so—these two restrictions, as currently imposed, infringe his rights in violation of the ADA (Title II), § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act (MERA), the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and the cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, including Articles 1, 10, 12, and 26 of the Declaration of Rights. They also offend the statutory requirement in G. L. c. 276, § 58 that conditions be the “least restrictive” necessary to ensure appearance and protect public safety.

Specifically, Petitioner is barred from taking his only effective, physician-supervised ADHD medication—an amphetamine micro-dose—because of a blanket “no illegal-drug” policy. The District Court order makes no individualized findings linking this FDA-approved prescription to flight risk or danger, thus violating well-established precedent that bail conditions be narrowly tailored under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750-51 (1987); Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). Petitioner seeks emergency relief as he suffers daily cognitive, vocational, and psychological harm from loss of access to vital medication.

II. JURISDICTION

This Court’s Single Justice may review bail or related release conditions when they infringe constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 458 (2002). General Laws c. 211, § 3 confers broad “superintendence of the entire judicial system.” Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762, slip op. at 4-5 (July 17, 2025). Petitioner has no other practical remedy because the Middlesex Superior Court denied review without findings, and trial is not set until 2 December 2025.

III. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

• 26 Sep. 2024 – Arraignment in the Woburn District Court on one count of assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, § 13A. The challenged pretrial-release conditions were imposed.  
• 17 Jul. 2025 – Middlesex Superior Court denied review without findings.  
• Trial is scheduled for 2 Dec. 2025. No other adequate remedy exists.

IV. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Whether a blanket prohibition on all “illegal drugs,” unaccompanied by individualized findings, violates the ADA, § 504, MERA, and the constitutional due-process guarantees by forcing Petitioner off medically prescribed amphetamine for ADHD.  
2. Whether, under G. L. c. 276, § 58, an unqualified ban on prescribed medication—without proof that the medication contributes to flight risk or danger—constitutes an abuse of discretion warranting superintendence relief.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioner respectfully incorporates ¶¶ 7–16 of his prior Superior Court filing verbatim, detailing (a) his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD diagnosis, (b) his established medical history and current prescription, (c) the District Court’s unconditional “no drugs” edict, and (d) the dire cognitive and emotional consequences he suffers with each passing day.

VI. ARGUMENT

A. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE ADA AND § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT

1. Title II of the ADA Requires Reasonable Accommodations in Bail Conditions

Under Title II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability,” be “excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of ... services, programs, or activities of a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Bail and pre-trial release conditions clearly constitute a “program” or “service” of the courts. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 527-29 (2004) (finding Title II covers court operations, including criminal proceedings). Moreover, Department of Justice regulations (28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), § 35.152(b)(2)) and Supreme Court precedent favor inclusive measures. Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999). Consequently, a court must engage in an individualized assessment before depriving a defendant of medication. Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234, at *11-12 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024).

Here, the District Court made no individualized inquiry into Petitioner’s prescription status, nor did it properly address Petitioner’s disability or alternative safeguards. This “blanket ban” approach violates Title II and contravenes Massachusetts and federal authority requiring bail restrictions to be carefully tailored. See Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 87-88 (2016). 

2. Court Decisions Uniformly Reject Blanket Bans on Prescribed Medication

Every federal court considering similar medication-prohibition policies has struck them down as violative of Title II and its “reasonable accommodation” mandate. See, e.g., Smith v. Aroostook County, 922 F.3d 41, 44–45 (1st Cir. 2019) (affirming injunction ordering jail to provide buprenorphine); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35, 46–47 (D. Mass. 2018) (categorical denial of opioid use disorder medication was discriminatory). The Massachusetts Trial Court’s 2022 settlement with the Department of Justice confirmed that blanket bans on validly prescribed medications in bail settings violate Title II. Settlement Agreement Between U.S. & Mass. Trial Court §§ 2–9 (2022). The same analysis applies under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which parallels the ADA. See Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2004).

B. THE CONDITIONS VIOLATE THE FOURTH, FIFTH, EIGHTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS

1. Substantive Due Process – Bodily Integrity

Compulsory cessation of prescribed medication that a physician has deemed the only effective treatment interferes with liberty interests in bodily integrity and medical autonomy. See Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 229 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135-36 (1992). Massachusetts case law likewise protects the patient’s right to medical autonomy under both Article 10 and Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights. Commonwealth v. Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618, 626-27 (1996). Here, Petitioner’s core liberty interest in maintaining his medically necessary ADHD medication is violated.

2. The Fourth Amendment – Random Urinalysis as an Unreasonable Search

Random urinalysis constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, requiring particularized “special needs” or individualized suspicion. Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989). Without findings or evidence of any nexus between Petitioner’s ADHD medication and flight risk or criminogenic behavior, the random urinalysis requirement is unreasonable. Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 77-78 (2001) (rejecting suspicionless searches absent a valid “special needs” rationale). Under Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the standard for reasonableness in searches is also unmet.

3. The Eighth Amendment and Article 26 – Excessive Conditions

Pre-trial detention or restrictive conditions must not exceed what is necessary to ensure public safety and appearance. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 754-55 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1951); see also Article 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which bars excessive bail. Without any individualized showing that Petitioner’s prescription poses a risk to others or to his attendance at trial, the “no drugs” condition and random testing are excessive.

4. Procedural Due Process – Lack of Findings

Restrictive bail conditions that significantly impair a defendant’s liberty interest must be supported by particularized findings. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-37 (1979). The District Court did not articulate specific reasons or address alternatives, effectively imposing a punitive condition in violation of Petitioner’s presumption of innocence.

C. VIOLATION OF MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT (MERA)

MERA (G. L. c. 93, § 103) ensures that all persons “have the same rights enjoyed by other citizens … regardless of … handicap.” Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844, 851-52 (2004). Denying Petitioner his only effective treatment for ADHD amounts to discrimination per se, as it restricts his ability to meaningfully participate in pre-trial supervision. MERA, construed expansively, offers even broader protection than the ADA. Bain v. Springfield, 424 Mass. 758, 766-67 (1997).

D. ABUSE OF DISCRETION UNDER G. L. c. 276, § 58

Under G. L. c. 276, § 58, courts must impose the “least restrictive” conditions necessary to ensure appearance and protect the community. Commonwealth v. Lougee, 485 Mass. 70, 75-77 (2020). Conditions must be individually tailored, and the trial court must articulate findings. Commonwealth v. Diggs, 475 Mass. 79, 88-89 (2016). The District Court’s failure to consider “less restrictive alternatives”—such as monitored prescription use, physician attestations, or direct verification of dosage—renders its blanket prohibition an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 476 Mass. 163, 172-73 (2017); Commonwealth v. Eldred, 480 Mass. 90, 95-96 (2018); Commonwealth v. Durling, 407 Mass. 108, 112-13 (1990).

E. SUPERINTENDENCE RELIEF IS JUSTIFIED

Under G. L. c. 211, § 3, relief is warranted where, as here, a lower court’s order causes a substantial infringement of rights—particularly where irreparable harm occurs due to deprivation of essential medication. Votta v. Police Dep’t of Billerica, 444 Mass. 1001 (2005). With no adequate remedy at law, superintendence by the Supreme Judicial Court is the appropriate forum.

F. INJUNCTIVE-RELIEF FACTORS WEIGH HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER

Petitioner also satisfies the factors for emergency injunctive relief. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). First, he is likely to succeed on the merits, given the array of authoritative holdings condemning categorical medication bans. Second, the irreparable harm is ongoing: each day without medication erodes Petitioner’s mental health, undermines his vocational stability, and jeopardizes trial preparation. Third, the balance of harms favors Petitioner’s constitutionally protected interests. Fourth, enforcing compliance with federal disability law serves the public interest. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

G. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

Finally, bail conditions must refrain from punishing a defendant before adjudication. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535-37. The challenged conditions transgress that rule by imposing punitive burdens on Petitioner’s freedom and health, absent showing of necessity.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests this Court to:

(a) VACATE forthwith the blanket “no drugs” provision and random urinalysis requirements insofar as they prohibit Petitioner’s lawfully prescribed micro-dose amphetamine or mandate intrusive random testing without individualized findings;  
(b) REMAND the matter with instructions to craft reasonable, narrowly tailored conditions consistent with the ADA and G. L. c. 276, § 58, including permitting supervised prescription use and other moderate safeguards in lieu of a total ban;  
(c) In the alternative, REPORT the constitutional and statutory issues to the full Court for review; and  
(d) Grant such other relief as justice may require, including any expedited remedy, to prevent ongoing and irreparable harm.

VIII. REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED TREATMENT

Petitioner continues to suffer immediate cognitive, emotional, and vocational harm daily—injuries not adequately repairable post-trial. He respectfully urges this Court to accord priority review and emergency relief.
