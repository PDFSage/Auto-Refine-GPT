COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT  
FOR THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  
SINGLE‐JUSTICE SESSION  
DOCKET NO. SJ-2025-_____  

IN RE BO SHANG,  
Petitioner.  

PETITION UNDER G.L. c. 211, § 3 AND SJC RULE 2:22  
FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRE-TRIAL RELEASE CONDITIONS  

I. INTRODUCTION  
Petitioner Bo Shang, charged with assault and battery (G.L. c. 265, § 13A), seeks vacatur of two conditions imposed by Woburn District Court on September 26, 2024 (Dkt. No. 5531568):  
  1. A categorical ban on “any illegal drugs,” and  
  2. Mandatory, suspicionless random urinalysis.  

These conditions (a) deny Petitioner a reasonable accommodation for his severe dopamine-deficit ADHD—responsive only to medically supervised micro-dosed amphetamine—and (b) rest on no individualized findings of flight risk or danger. They violate:

• Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, .139 (Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999));  
• Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2004));  
• Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, G.L. c. 93, § 103 (Shedlock v. Dep’t of Corr., 442 Mass. 844 (2004));  
• Fourth Amendment and Art. 14 (Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Ferguson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67 (2001));  
• Eighth Amendment/Art. 26 & Excessive Bail Clause (United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Brangan v. Commonwealth, 477 Mass. 691 (2017));  
• Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process (Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127 (1992); Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003)); and  
• G.L. c. 276, § 58’s “least restrictive” requirements (Diggs v. Commonwealth, 475 Mass. 79 (2016); Lougee v. Commonwealth, 485 Mass. 70 (2020)).  

No adequate alternative remedy exists. Immediate relief is essential to prevent irreparable harm.

II. JURISDICTION  
A Single Justice may vacate bail orders infringing constitutional or statutory rights. Commonwealth v. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454, 460 (2002). When no adequate remedy exists, this Court’s superintendence power under G.L. c. 211, § 3, applies. Jones v. Commonwealth, SJC-13762 (July 17, 2025).

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
• 26 Sep 2024—Woburn District Court imposes the challenged conditions.  
• 17 Jul 2025—Middlesex Superior Court denies review without findings.  
• Trial set for 2 Dec 2025.

IV. FACTS  
Petitioner suffers from severe ADHD documented in an October 2024 neuropsychological report (Worcester Recovery Ctr. & Hosp./DMH). Only micro-dosed amphetamine stabilizes his cognition. At arraignment, counsel presented the valid prescription and expert report. Despite this, the court imposed a blanket drug ban and random urinalysis without any medical or risk-assessment findings.

V. ARGUMENT  

A. TITLE II OF THE ADA & § 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  
1. Coverage: Title II bars any public entity from excluding qualified individuals from “programs,” including bail. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004); Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998). Section 504 “parallels” Title II. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19–20.  
2. Reasonable Modification: DOJ regulations require an individualized medical assessment before excluding prescription medication. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(b)(7), .139(a); Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603; Nunes v. Mass. Dep’t of Corr., 766 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2014). A per se ban on amphetamine, Petitioner’s only effective treatment, denies this accommodation.  
3. No Blanket Bans: Exclusion of prescribed medication demands evidence-based findings of a direct threat or fundamental alteration. 28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b); Theriault v. Flynn, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 11234 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). Courts have enjoined similar bans. Smith v. Aroostook Cnty., 922 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2019); Pesce v. Coppinger, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018); Kortlever v. Whatcom Cnty., 2019 WL 2179222 (W.D. Wash. 2019). DOJ-Trial Court Settlement (2022) bars blanket pre-trial bans.  
4. No Stereotypes: Congress forbade reliance on “myths, fears, and stereotypes” about disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7).

B. FOURTH AMENDMENT & ART. 14  
Random urinalysis is a search. Skinner, 489 U.S. at 617; Ferguson, 532 U.S. at 77–78. Suspicionless testing violates the Fourth Amendment without individualized suspicion or special-needs justification. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997); Ferrer, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 246 (2016).

C. EIGHTH AMENDMENT/EXCESSIVE BAIL & ART. 26  
“Liberty is the norm,” pre-trial restraint the exception. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 754–55; Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6; Brangan, 477 Mass. at 698–700. Conditions forcing discontinuation of treatment or non-compliance (and detention) are “excessive.”

D. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS  
1. Substantive Liberty: Detainees have a protected liberty interest in refusing forced medication withdrawal. Harper, 494 U.S. 210; Riggins, 504 U.S. 127; Sell, 539 U.S. 166; Brosnahan, 421 Mass. 618; Eldred, 480 Mass. 90.  
2. Procedural Due Process: Requires written, specific findings balancing state interests against medical necessity. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319; Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520. None were made.

E. MASSACHUSETTS EQUAL RIGHTS ACT  
MERA prohibits disability discrimination by “any person.” Denying access to essential medication is per se discriminatory. Shedlock, 442 Mass. at 851–52; Bain, 424 Mass. at 766–67.

F. G.L. c. 276, § 58 (“LEAST RESTRICTIVE”)  
Bail conditions must be narrowly tailored. Diggs, 475 Mass. at 87–89; Lougee, 485 Mass. at 75–77. The court made no findings linking amphetamine to risk and ignored less-restrictive alternatives (verified prescriptions, supervised dispensing, clinician attestations, electronic pill dispensers). Peterson, 476 Mass. 163; Durling, 407 Mass. 108.

G. SUPERINTENDENCE & INJUNCITVE-RELIEF STANDARDS  
Under G.L. c. 211, § 3, a Single Justice may vacate orders infringing rights. Laurie, 437 Mass. 454; Votta, 444 Mass. 1001; Jones, supra. Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), requires:  
  • Likelihood of success—overwhelming here;  
  • Irreparable harm—forced medication cessation inflicts irreversible harm (Riggins, 504 U.S. 127, 134–35);  
  • Balance of equities—stable treatment promotes safety;  
  • Public interest—upholding disability rights and equal access.

H. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE  
Pre-trial detainees cannot be punished before conviction. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535–37; Stack, 342 U.S. at 5–6.

VII. RELIEF REQUESTED  
Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:

1. VACATE the categorical ban on “any illegal drugs” and the random urinalysis requirement;  
2. REMAND with instructions to craft a reasonable accommodation permitting medically supervised micro-dosing of amphetamine under less-restrictive monitoring;  
3. Alternatively, REPORT the constitutional and statutory questions to the full Court; and  
4. GRANT any further relief necessary to prevent ongoing, irreparable harm, including expedited consideration.
